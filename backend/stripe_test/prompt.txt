Explore the [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-single-subscription) or the [demo](https://checkout.stripe.dev/).

## What you’ll build

This guide describes how to sell fixed-price monthly subscriptions using [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout.md).

This guide shows you how to:

- Model your business by building a product catalogue.
- Add a Checkout session to your site, including a button and success and cancellation pages.
- Monitor subscription events and provision access to your service.
- Set up the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md).
- Add a customer portal session to your site, including a button and redirect.
- Let customers manage their subscription through the portal.
- Learn how to use [flexible billing mode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md) to access enhanced billing behaviour and additional features.

If you aren’t ready to code an integration, you can set up basic subscriptions [manually in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/subscriptions.md) or use [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links.md) to set up subscriptions without writing any code.

Learn more about [designing an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/design-an-integration.md) to understand the decisions and required resources for a full integration.

After you complete the integration, you can extend it to:

- Display [taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes.md)
- Apply [discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/coupons.md#using-coupons-in-checkout)
- Offer customers a [free trial period](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials.md)
- Add [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md)
- Integrate the [hosted invoice page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page.md)
- Use Checkout in [setup mode](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md)
- Set up [usage-based billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md#usage-based-pricing), [pricing tiers](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md#tiered-pricing) and [usage-based pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md#usage-based-pricing)
- Manage [prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md)
- Allow customers to [subscribe to multiple products](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/quantities.md#multiple-product-sub)
- Integrate [entitlements](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md) to manage access to your product’s features

## Set up Stripe

Install the Stripe client of your choice:


#### Python

```bash
# Install through pip
pip3 install --upgrade stripe
```

```bash
# Or find the Stripe package on http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stripe/
```

```python
# Find the version you want to pin:
# https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
# Specify that version in your requirements.txt file
stripe>=5.0.0
```


Optionally, install the Stripe CLI. The CLI provides [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook) testing and you can run it to create your products and prices.
For additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).
## Create the pricing model [Dashboard or Stripe CLI]

Build your [pricing model](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md) with *Products* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions).

## Create a Checkout Session [Client and Server]

Add a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a Checkout Session.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Checkout</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="/create-checkout-session" method="POST">
      <!-- Note: If using PHP set the action to /create-checkout-session.php -->

      <input type="hidden" name="priceId" value="price_G0FvDp6vZvdwRZ" />
      <button type="submit">Checkout</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

On the back end of your application, define an endpoint that [creates the session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) for your front end to call. You need these values:

- The price ID of the subscription the customer is signing up for (your front end passes this value)
- Your `success_url`, which is a page on your website that Checkout returns your customer to after they complete the payment

You can optionally:

- Use `cancel_url` to provide a page on your website where Checkout returns your customer, if they cancel the payment process.
- Configure a [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle.md) to your subscription in this call.
- Use [custom text](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/policies.md?payment-ui=embedded-form#customize-payment-method-reuse-agreement-and-subscription-terms) to include your subscription and cancellation terms and a link to where your customers can update or cancel their subscription. We recommend configuring [email reminders and notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email.md#email-configuration) for your subscribers.

If you created a one-off price in [step 2](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions.md#create-pricing-model), pass that price ID as well. After creating a Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.

You can enable more accurate and predictable subscription behaviour when you create a Checkout Session by setting the [billing mode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md) type to `flexible`. You must use the Stripe API version [2025-06-30.basil](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/basil.md#2025-06-30.basil) or later.

> You can use [lookup_keys](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices.md#lookup-keys) to fetch prices rather than price IDs. For an example, see the [sample application](https://github.com/stripe-samples/subscription-use-cases/tree/main/fixed-price-subscriptions).

#### Python

```python

# The price ID passed from the front end.
#   price_id = request.form.get('priceId')
price_id = '{{PRICE_ID}}'

session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    success_url='https://example.com/success.html?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',
    cancel_url='https://example.com/canceled.html',
    mode='subscription',
    line_items=[{
        'price': price_id,
        # For usage-based billing, don't pass quantity
        'quantity': 1
    }],
    subscription_data={
        'billing_mode': {
            'type': 'flexible'
        }
    }
)

# Redirect to the URL returned on the session
#   return redirect(session.url, code=303)
```

This example customises the `success_url` by appending the session ID. Learn more about [customising your success page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-success-page.md).

From your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods), enable the payment methods you want to accept from your customers. Checkout supports [several payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#product-support).

## Provision and monitor subscriptions [Server]

After the subscription signup succeeds, the customer returns to your website at the `success_url`, which initiates a `checkout.session.completed` *webhook* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests). When you receive a `checkout.session.completed` event, use [entitlements](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md) to provision the subscription. Continue to provision each month (if billing monthly) as you receive `invoice.paid` events. If you receive an `invoice.payment_failed` event, notify your customer and send them to the customer portal to update their payment method.

To determine the next step for your system’s logic, check the event type and parse the payload of each [event object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object.md), such as `invoice.paid`. Store the `subscription.id` and `customer.id` event objects in your database for verification.

For testing purposes, you can monitor events in the [Events tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/events) of [Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench.md). For production, set up a webhook endpoint and subscribe to appropriate event types. If you don’t know your `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` key, go to the destination details view of the [Webhooks tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks) in Workbench to view it.


#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_received():
  webhook_secret = '{{STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET}}' # Example: whsec_c7681Dm
  request_data = json.loads(request.data)

  if webhook_secret:
    # Retrieve the event by verifying the signature using the raw body and secret if webhook signing is configured.
    signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')
    try:
      event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
          payload=request.data, sig_header=signature, secret=webhook_secret)
      data = event['data']
    except Exception as e:
      return e
    # Get the type of webhook event sent - used to check the status of PaymentIntents.
    event_type = event['type']
  else:
    data = request_data['data']
    event_type = request_data['type']
  data_object = data['object']

  if event_type == 'checkout.session.completed':
    # Payment is successful and the subscription is created.
    # You should provision the subscription and save the customer ID to your database.
    print(data)
  elif event_type == 'invoice.paid':
    # Continue to provision the subscription as payments continue to be made.
    # Store the status in your database and check when a user accesses your service.
    # This approach helps you avoid hitting rate limits.
    print(data)
  elif event_type == 'invoice.payment_failed':
    # The payment failed or the customer doesn't have a valid payment method.
    # The subscription becomes past_due. Notify your customer and send them to the
    # customer portal to update their payment information.
    print(data)
  else:
    print('Unhandled event type {}'.format(event_type))

  return jsonify({'status': 'success'})
```

The minimum event types to monitor:

| Event name                   | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkout.session.completed` | Sent when a customer successfully completes the Checkout Session, informing you of a new purchase. |
| `invoice.paid`               | Sent each billing period when a payment succeeds.                                                  |
| `invoice.payment_failed`     | Sent each billing period if there’s an issue with your customer’s payment method.                  |

For even more events to monitor, see [Subscription webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md).

## Configure the customer portal [Dashboard]

The [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md) lets your customers directly manage their existing subscriptions and invoices.

Use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal) to configure the portal. At a minimum, make sure to [configure the portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md) so that customers can update their payment methods.

## Create a portal session [Server]

Define an endpoint that [creates the customer portal session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions/create.md) for your front end to call. The `CUSTOMER_ID` refers to the customer ID created by a Checkout Session that you saved while processing the `checkout.session.completed` event. You can also set a default redirect link for the portal in the Dashboard.

Pass an optional `return_url` value for the page on your site to redirect your customer to after they finish managing their subscription:

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

# This is the URL that the customer is redirected to after they're
# done managing their billing with the portal.
return_url = '{{DOMAIN_URL}}' # Example: http://example.com
customer_id = '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}' # Example: cus_GBV60HKsE0mb5v

session = stripe.billing_portal.Session.create(
    customer=customer_id,
    return_url=return_url,
)

# redirect to the URL for the session
#   return redirect(session.url, code=303)
```

## Send customers to the customer portal [Client]

On your front end, add a button to the page at the `success_url` that provides a link to the customer portal:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Manage Billing</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="/customer-portal" method="POST">
      <!-- Note: If using PHP set the action to /customer-portal.php -->
      <button type="submit">Manage Billing</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

After exiting the customer portal, the customer returns to your website at the `return_url`. Continue to [monitor events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md) to track the status of the customer’s subscription.

If you configure the customer portal to allow actions such as cancelling a subscription, [monitor additional events](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/integrate-customer-portal.md#webhooks).

### Create a product and price

Build your [pricing model](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md) with *Products* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions).

If you offer multiple billing periods, use Checkout to [upsell](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/upsells.md) customers on longer billing periods and collect more revenue upfront.

For other pricing models, see [Billing examples](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md).

### Create a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a *Checkout Session* (A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions through Checkout. After a successful payment, the Checkout Session contains a reference to the Customer, and either the successful PaymentIntent or an active Subscription).

When you create the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md), pass the following parameters:

- To use the embedded payment form, set [ui_mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-ui_mode) to `embedded`.
- To create subscriptions when your customer checks out, set [mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-mode) to `subscription`.
- To define the page your customer returns to after completing or attempting payment, specify a [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-return_url). Include the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable in the URL. Checkout replaces the variable with the Checkout Session ID before redirecting your customer. You create and host the return page on your website.
- To include your subscription and cancellation terms and a link to where your customers can update or cancel their subscription, optionally use [custom text](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/policies.md?payment-ui=embedded-form#customize-payment-method-reuse-agreement-and-subscription-terms). We recommend configuring [email reminders and notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email.md#email-configuration) for your subscribers.

To mount Checkout, use the Checkout Session’s `client_secret` returned in the response.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d mode=subscription \
  -d "line_items[0][price]"="{{PRICE_ID}}" \
  -d "line_items[0][quantity]"=1 \
  -d ui_mode=embedded \
  --data-urlencode return_url="https://example.com/checkout/return?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}"
```

```cli
stripe checkout sessions create  \
  --mode=subscription \
  -d "line_items[0][price]"="{{PRICE_ID}}" \
  -d "line_items[0][quantity]"=1 \
  --ui-mode=embedded \
  --return-url="https://example.com/checkout/return?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}"
```



```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
session = client.v1.checkout.sessions.create({
  "mode": "subscription",
  "line_items": [{"price": "{{PRICE_ID}}", "quantity": 1}],
  "ui_mode": "embedded",
  "return_url": "https://example.com/checkout/return?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
})
```





```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  line_items: [
    {
      price: '{{PRICE_ID}}',
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  ui_mode: 'embedded',
  return_url: 'https://example.com/checkout/return?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',
});
```





## Build your subscription page [Client]

### Mount Checkout

#### HTML + JS

#### Load Stripe.js

Use *Stripe.js* (Use Stripe.js’ APIs to tokenize customer information, collect sensitive card data, and accept payments with browser payment APIs) to remain *PCI compliant* (Any party involved in processing, transmitting, or storing credit card data must comply with the rules specified in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business) by ensuring that payment details are sent directly to Stripe without hitting your server. Always load Stripe.js from js.stripe.com to remain compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host it yourself.

#### Define the payment form

To securely collect the customer’s information, create an empty placeholder `div`. Stripe inserts an iframe into the `div`.

Checkout is available as part of [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js.md). Include the Stripe.js script on your page by adding it to the head of your HTML file. Next, create an empty DOM node (container) to use for mounting.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Accept a payment</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A demo of a payment on Stripe" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /><!-- Add the Stripe.js script here -->
    <script src="https://js.stripe.com/clover/stripe.js"></script>
    <script src="checkout.js" defer></script>
  </head><body>
    <!-- Display a payment form -->
      <div id="checkout">
        <!-- Checkout inserts the payment form here -->
      </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Initialise Stripe.js

Initialise Stripe.js with your publishable API key.

#### Fetch a Checkout Session client secret

Create an asynchronous `fetchClientSecret` function that makes a request to your server to [create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and retrieve the client secret.

#### Initialise Checkout

Initialise Checkout with your `fetchClientSecret` function and mount it to the placeholder `<div>` in your payment form. Checkout is rendered in an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection.

Avoid placing Checkout within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.



#### React

#### Add Stripe to your React app

Install [React Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md) to stay PCI compliant by ensuring that payment details go directly to Stripe and never reach your server.

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

#### Load Stripe.js

To configure the Stripe library, call `loadStripe()` with your Stripe publishable API key. Create an `EmbeddedCheckoutProvider`. Pass the returned `Promise` to the provider.

#### Fetch a Checkout Session client secret

Create an asynchronous `fetchClientSecret` function that makes a request to your server to [create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and retrieve the client secret.

#### Initialise Checkout

To allow the child components to access the Stripe service through the embedded Checkout consumer, pass the resulting promise from `loadStripe` and the `fetchClientSecret` function as an `option` to the embedded Checkout provider.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';
import {
  EmbeddedCheckoutProvider,
  EmbeddedCheckout
} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

// Make sure to call `loadStripe` outside of a component's render to avoid
// recreating the `Stripe` object on every render.
const stripePromise = loadStripe('pk_test_123', {
});

const App = ({fetchClientSecret}) => {
  const options = {fetchClientSecret};

  return (
    <EmbeddedCheckoutProvider
      stripe={stripePromise}
      options={options}
    >
      <EmbeddedCheckout />
    </EmbeddedCheckoutProvider>
  )
}
```

## Show a return page

After your customer attempts payment, Stripe redirects them to a return page that you host on your site. When you created the Checkout Session, you specified the URL of the return page in the [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-return_url) parameter.

> During payment, some payment methods redirect the customer to an intermediate page, such as a bank authorisation page. When the customer completes that page, Stripe redirects them to your return page.

#### Create an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session status with the Checkout Session ID in the URL.

#### Retrieve a Checkout Session

To use details for the Checkout Session, immediately make a request to the endpoint on your server to [retrieve the Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/retrieve.md) status using the Checkout Session ID in the URL as soon as your return page loads.

#### Handle the session

Handle the result based on the session status:

- `complete`: The payment succeeded. Use the information from the Checkout Session to render a success page.
- `open`: The payment failed or was cancelled. Remount Checkout so that your customer can try again.

```js
// Retrieve a Checkout Session
// Use the session ID
initialize();

async function initialize() {
  const queryString = window.location.search;
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
  const sessionId = urlParams.get('session_id');
  const response = await fetch(`/session-status?session_id=${sessionId}`);
  const session = await response.json();
// Handle the session according to its status
  if (session.status == 'open') {
    // Remount embedded Checkout
    window.location.replace('http://localhost:4242/checkout.html')
  } else if (session.status == 'complete') {
    document.getElementById('success').classList.remove('hidden');
    document.getElementById('customer-email').textContent = session.customer_email;
    // Show success page
    // Optionally use session.payment_status or session.customer_email
    // to customize the success page
  }
}
```



## Optional: Configure the customer portal

You can set up the *customer portal* (The customer portal is a secure, Stripe-hosted page that lets your customers manage their subscriptions and billing details) to let your customers directly manage their existing subscriptions and invoices.

You can configure the portal in the Dashboard. To reduce churn, you can configure the portal to allow customers to update their payment methods in the case of failed payments.

To help customers find it, add a button on your website to redirect to the customer portal to allow customers to manage their subscription. Clicking this button redirects your customer to the Stripe-hosted customer portal page.

Learn more about the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md) and other customer management options.

#### Create a portal session

To add a customer portal, define an endpoint that [creates the customer portal session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions/create.md) for your front end to call. The `CUSTOMER_ID` refers to the customer ID created by a Checkout Session that you saved while processing the `checkout.session.completed` webhook. You can also set a default redirect link for the portal in the Dashboard.

Pass an optional `return_url` value for the page on your site to redirect your customer to after they finish managing their subscription:

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

# This is the URL that the customer is redirected to after they're
# done managing their billing with the portal.
return_url = '{{DOMAIN_URL}}' # Example: http://example.com
customer_id = '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}' # Example: cus_GBV60HKsE0mb5v

session = stripe.billing_portal.Session.create(
    customer=customer_id,
    return_url=return_url,
)

# redirect to the URL for the session
#   return redirect(session.url, code=303)
```

#### Send customers to the customer portal

On your front end, add a button to the page at the `success_url` that provides a link to the customer portal:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Manage Billing</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="/customer-portal" method="POST">
      <!-- Note: If using PHP set the action to /customer-portal.php -->
      <button type="submit">Manage Billing</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

After exiting the customer portal, the customer returns to your website at the `return_url`. Continue to [monitor events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md) to track the status of the customer’s subscription.

If you configure the customer portal to allow actions such as cancelling a subscription, make sure to monitor [additional events](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/integrate-customer-portal.md#webhooks).

## Provision access

When the subscription is active, give your user access to your service. To do this, listen to the `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated` and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.  These events pass a `Subscription` object that contains a `status` field indicating whether the subscription is active, past due or cancelled. See the [subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md#subscription-lifecycle) for a complete list of statuses. To manage access to your product’s feature, learn about [integrating entitlements](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md).

In your webhook handler:

1. Verify the subscription status. If it’s `active`, your user has paid for your product.
1. Check the product that your customer subscribed to and grant them access to your service. Checking the product instead of the price allows you to change the pricing or billing period, as needed.
1. Store the `product.id`, `subscription.id` and `subscription.status` in your database, along with the `customer.id` you already saved. Check this record when determining which features to enable for the user in your application.

The subscription status might change at any point during its lifetime, even if your application doesn’t directly make any calls to Stripe. For example, a renewal might fail because of an expired credit card, which puts the subscription in a past due status. Or, if you implement the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md), a user might cancel their subscription without directly visiting your application. Implementing your handler correctly keeps your application status in sync with Stripe.

### Monitor events

Set up webhooks to listen to subscription change events, such as upgrades and cancellations. You can view [subscription webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md) in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events) or with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook).

Learn more about [testing your Billing integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing.md).



# Embedded components

> This is a Embedded components for when platform is web and ui is embedded-components. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?platform=web&ui=embedded-components.
Complexity: 2/5
Customise with the [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance.md?payment-ui=embedded-components).

Use this guide to learn how to sell fixed-price *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). You’ll use the [Payment Element with Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?platform=web&ui=embedded-components) to create a custom payment form that you embed in your application.

If you don’t want to build a custom payment form, you can integrate with hosted checkout. For an immersive version of that end-to-end integration guide, see the Billing [quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/quickstart.md).

If you aren’t ready to code an integration, you can set up basic subscriptions [manually in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/subscriptions.md). You can also use [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links.md) to set up subscriptions without writing any code. Learn more about [designing an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/design-an-integration.md) to understand the decisions you need to make and the resources you need.

## What you’ll build

This guide shows you how to:

- Model your business by building a product catalogue.
- Build a registration process that creates a customer.
- Create subscriptions and collect payment information.
- Test and monitor payment and subscription status.
- Let customers change their plan or cancel the subscription.

Use the Customer object associated with a subscription to make and track recurring charges and to manage the products that they subscribe to.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Entitlement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/active-entitlement.md) | Represents a customer’s access to a feature included in a service product that they subscribe to. When you create a subscription for a customer’s recurring purchase of a product, an active entitlement is automatically created for each feature associated with that product. When a customer accesses your services, use their active entitlements to enable the features included in their subscription. |
| [Feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/feature.md)                | Represents a function or ability that your customers can access when they subscribe to a service product. You can include features in a product by creating ProductFeatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices.md)                            | A statement of amounts a customer owes that tracks payment statuses from draft to paid or otherwise finalised. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md)               | A way to build dynamic payment flows. A PaymentIntent tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods. Invoices automatically create PaymentIntents.                                                                                                          |
| [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md)               | A customer’s payment methods that they use to pay for your products. For example, you can store a credit card on a Customer object and use it to make recurring payments for that customer. Typically, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices.md)                                | Defines the unit price, currency, and billing cycle for a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products.md)                            | Goods or services that your business sells. A service product can include one or more features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [ProductFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/product-feature.md)              | Represents a single feature’s inclusion in a single product. Each product is associated with a ProductFeature for each feature that it includes, and each feature is associated with a ProductFeature for each product that includes it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md)                  | Represents a customer’s scheduled recurring purchase of a product. Use a subscription to collect payments and provide repeated delivery of or continuous access to a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Here’s an example of how products, features and entitlements work together. Imagine that you want to set up a recurring service that offers two tiers: a standard product with basic functionality and an advanced product that adds extended functionality.

1. You create two features: `basic_features` and `extended_features`.
1. You create two products: `standard_product` and `advanced_product`.
1. For the standard product, you create one ProductFeature that associates `basic_features` with `standard_product`.
1. For the advanced product, you create two ProductFeatures: one that associates `basic_features` with `advanced_product` and one that associates `extended_features` with `advanced_product`.

A customer, `first_customer`, subscribes to the standard product. When you create the subscription, Stripe automatically creates an Entitlement that associates `first_customer` with `basic_features`.

Another customer, `second_customer`, subscribes to the advanced product. When you create the Subscription, Stripe automatically creates two Entitlements: one that associates `second_customer` with `basic_features`, and one that associates `second_customer` with `extended_features`.

You can determine which features to provision for a customer by [retrieving their active entitlements or listening to the Active Entitlement Summary event](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md#entitlements). You don’t have to retrieve their subscriptions, products, and features.

## Set up Stripe

Install the Stripe client of your choice:



#### Python

```bash
# Install through pip
pip3 install --upgrade stripe
```

```bash
# Or find the Stripe package on http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stripe/
```

```python
# Find the version you want to pin:
# https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
# Specify that version in your requirements.txt file
stripe>=5.0.0
```

```bash
# Or download the source directly: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php/releases
```

```xml
<!--
  For Maven, add the following dependency to your POM and replace with the
  version number you want to use from:
  - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.stripe/stripe-java or
  - https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java/releases/latest
-->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.stripe</groupId>
  <artifactId>stripe-java</artifactId>
  <version>30.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```bash
# For other environments, manually install the following JARs:
# - The Stripe JAR from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java/releases/latest
# - Google Gson from https://github.com/google/gson
```

And then install the Stripe CLI. The CLI provides webhook testing and you can run it to make API calls to Stripe.  This guide shows how to use the CLI to set up a pricing model in a later section.
For additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).
## Create the pricing model [Stripe CLI or Dashboard]

Build the pricing model with *Products* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions). Read the docs to learn more about [pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md).

## Create the Customer [Client and Server]

Stripe needs a *Customer* (Customer objects represent customers of your business. They let you reuse payment methods and give you the ability to track multiple payments) for each subscription. In your application front end, collect any necessary information from your users and pass it to the back end.

If you need to collect address details, the Address Element enables you to collect a shipping or billing address for your customers. For more information on the Address Element, see the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element.md) page.

```html
<form id="signup-form">
  <label>
    Email
    <input id="email" type="email" placeholder="Email address" value="test@example.com" required />
  </label>

  <button type="submit">
    Register
  </button>
</form>
```



On the server, create the Stripe Customer object.

> Make sure you store the [Customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-id) to use in the Checkout Session

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \

})
```





```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const customer = await stripe.customers.create({

  shipping: {
    address: {
      city: 'Brothers',
      country: 'US',
      line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',
      postal_code: '97712',
      state: 'CA',
    },
    name: '{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}',
  },
  address: {
    city: 'Brothers',
    country: 'US',
    line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',
    postal_code: '97712',
    state: 'CA',
  },
});
```





## Create a Checkout Session [Server]

On the back end of your application, define an endpoint that [creates the session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) for your front end to call. You’ll need the price ID of the subscription the customer is signing up for – your front end passes this value.

If you created a one-off price in [step 2](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions.md#create-pricing-model), pass that price ID also. After creating a Checkout Session, make sure you pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) back to the client in the response.

> You can use [lookup_keys](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices.md#lookup-keys) to fetch prices rather than Price IDs. See the [sample application](https://github.com/stripe-samples/subscription-use-cases/tree/main/fixed-price-subscriptions) for an example.

#### Python

```





From your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods), enable the payment methods you want to accept from your customers. Checkout supports [several payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#product-support).

## Initialise Checkout [Client]

#### HTML + JS

Create either a `clientSecret` promise that resolves with the client secret or set it as the secret directly. Call [initCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init), passing in `clientSecret`. `initCheckout` returns a promise that resolves to a [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/checkout_object) instance.

The [checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/checkout_object) object acts as the foundation of your checkout page and contains data from the Checkout Session and methods to update the Session.

The object returned by [checkout.session()](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session) contains your pricing information. We recommend reading and displaying the `total`, and `lineItems` from the session in your UI.

This lets you turn on new features with minimal code changes. For example, adding [manual currency prices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/custom/localize-prices/manual-currency-prices.md) requires no UI changes if you display the `total`.



```html
<div id="checkout-container"></div>
```

#### React

Create `clientSecret` as a `Promise<string> | string` containing the client secret returned by your server.

Wrap your application with the [CheckoutProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/checkout_provider) component, passing in `clientSecret` and the `stripe` instance.

Use the [useCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/use_checkout) hook in your components to get the [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/checkout_object) object, which contains data from the Checkout Session and methods to update the Session.

Use the `Checkout` object as the container for your prices. We recommend reading and displaying the `total` and `lineItems` from the `Checkout` object in your UI.

This lets you enable features with minimal code changes. For example, adding [manual currency prices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/custom/localize-prices/manual-currency-prices.md) requires no UI changes if you display the `total`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {CheckoutProvider} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout';
import CheckoutForm from './CheckoutForm';

const clientSecret = fetch('/create-checkout-session', {method: 'POST'})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => json.checkoutSessionClientSecret);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <CheckoutProvider
      stripe={stripe}options={{clientSecret}}
    >
      <CheckoutForm />
    </CheckoutProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {useCheckout} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout';

const CheckoutForm = () => {const checkoutState = useCheckout();
  switch (checkoutState.type) {
    case "loading": return <div>Loading ...</div>;
    case "error": return <div>Error: {checkoutState.error.message}</div>;
    case "success":
      return (
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(checkoutState.checkout.lineItems, null, 2)}
          // A formatted total amount
          Total: {checkoutState.checkout.total.total.amount}
        </pre>
      );
  }
};
```

## Collect payment information [Client]

Collect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). The Payment Element is a pre-built UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.

#### HTML + JS

First, create a container DOM element to mount the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). Then create an instance of the `Payment Element` using [checkout.createPaymentElement](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element) and mount it by calling [element.mount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/mount), providing either a CSS selector or the container DOM element.

```html
<div id="payment-element"></div>
```



See the [Stripe.js docs](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element#custom_checkout_create_payment_element-options) to view the supported options.

You can [customise the appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance.md) of all Elements by passing [elementsOptions.appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init#custom_checkout_init-options-elementsOptions-appearance) when initialising Checkout on the front end.

#### React

Mount the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) component within the [CheckoutProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/checkout_provider).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {PaymentElement, useCheckout} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout';

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  const checkoutState = useCheckout();
  return (
    <form>
      <PaymentElement options={{layout: 'accordion'}}/>
    </form>
  )
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

See the [Stripe.js docs](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element#custom_checkout_create_payment_element-options) to view the supported options.

You can [customise the appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance.md) of all Elements by passing [elementsOptions.appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/checkout_provider#custom_checkout_react_checkout_provider-options-elementsOptions-appearance) to the [CheckoutProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/checkout_provider).

## Submit the payment [Client-side]

#### HTML + JS

Render a **Pay** button that calls [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/confirm) from the [checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/checkout_object) instance to submit the payment.

```html
<button id="pay-button">Pay</button>
<div id="confirm-errors"></div>
```

```js

const checkout = stripe.initCheckout({clientSecret});
const loadActionsResult = await checkout.loadActions();

if (loadActionsResult.type === 'success') {
  const {actions} = loadActionsResult;
  onst button = document.getElementById('pay-button');
  const errors = document.getElementById('confirm-errors');
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Clear any validation errors
    errors.textContent = '';

    actions.confirm().then((result) => {
      if (result.type === 'error') {
        errors.textContent = result.error.message;
      }
    });
  });
}
```

#### React

Render a **Pay** button that calls [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/confirm) from [useCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/use_checkout) to submit the payment.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {useCheckout} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout';

const PayButton = () => {
  const checkoutState = useCheckout();
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setLoading(true);
    confirm().then((result) => {
      if (result.type === 'error') {
        setError(result.error)
      }
      setLoading(false);
    })
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button disabled={loading} onClick={handleClick}>
        Pay
      </button>
      {error && <div>{error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  )
};

export default PayButton;
```

## Listen for webhooks [Server]

To complete the integration, you need to process *webhooks* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) sent by Stripe. These events are triggered whenever the status in Stripe changes, such as subscriptions creating new invoices. In your application, set up an HTTP handler to accept a POST request containing the webhook event and verify the signature of the event:

```



During development, use the Stripe CLI to [observe webhooks and forward them to your application](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook). Run the following in a new terminal while your development app is running:

#### curl

```bash
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

For production, set up a webhook endpoint URL in the Dashboard or use the [Webhook Endpoints API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints.md).

You need to listen to a few events to complete the remaining steps in this guide. See [Subscription events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md#events) for more details about subscription-specific webhooks.

## Provision access to your service [Client and Server]

Now that the subscription is active, give your user access to your service.  To do this, listen to the `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated` and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.  These events pass a subscription object that contains a `status` field indicating whether the subscription is active, past due or cancelled.  See [the subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md#subscription-lifecycle) for a complete list of statuses.

In your webhook handler:

1. Verify the subscription status.  If it’s `active` then your user has paid for your product.
1. Check the product the customer subscribed to and grant access to your service. Checking the product instead of the price gives you more flexibility if you need to change the pricing or billing period.
1. Store the `product.id`, `subscription.id` and `subscription.status` in your database along with the `customer.id` you already saved.  Check this record when determining which features to enable for the user in your application.

The status of a subscription might change at any point during its lifetime, even if your application doesn’t directly make any calls to Stripe. For example, a renewal might fail because of an expired credit card, which puts the subscription into a past due status. Or, if you implement the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md), a user might cancel their subscription without directly visiting your application. Implementing your handler correctly keeps your application status in sync with Stripe.

## Cancel the subscription [Client and Server]

It’s common to allow customers to cancel their subscriptions. This example adds a cancellation option to the account settings page.
![Sample subscription cancellation interface.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fixed-price-subscriptions-guide-account-settings.6559626ba4b434826a67abfea165e097.png)

Account settings with the ability to cancel the subscription



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/cancel-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def cancelSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
         # Cancel the subscription by deleting it
        deletedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.delete(data['subscriptionId'])
        return jsonify(deletedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your application receives a `customer.subscription.deleted` event.

After the subscription is cancelled, update your database to remove the Stripe subscription ID you previously stored and limit access to your service.

When a subscription cancels, you can’t reactivate it. Instead, collect updated billing information from your customer, update their default payment method and create a new subscription with their existing customer record.

### Monitor events

Set up webhooks to listen to subscription change events, such as upgrades and cancellations. Learn more about [subscription webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md). You can view events in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events) or with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook).

For more details, see [testing your Billing integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing.md).

## Optional: Let customers change their plans [Client and Server]

To let your customers change their subscription, collect the price ID of the option they want to change to. Then send the new price ID from the front end to a back end endpoint. This example also passes the subscription ID, but you can retrieve it from your database for your logged in user.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call, passing the subscription ID and the new price ID. The subscription is now Premium, at 15 USD per month, instead of Basic at 5 USD per month.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/update-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def updateSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        updatedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.modify(
            data['subscriptionId'],
            cancel_at_period_end=False,
            items=[{
                'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
            }]
        )
        return jsonify(updatedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your application receives a `customer.subscription.updated` event.

## Optional: Preview a price change [Client and Server]

When your customer changes their subscription, there’s often an adjustment to the amount they owe, known as a [proration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md). You can use the [create preview invoice endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview.md) to display the adjusted amount to your customers.

On the front end, pass the create preview invoice details to a back end endpoint.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-preview-invoice', methods=['POST'])
def createPreviewInvoice():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        # Retrieve the subscription
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        # Retrieve the invoice
        invoice = stripe.Invoice.create_preview(
            customer=data['customerId'],
            subscription=data['subscriptionId'],
            subscription_details={
              "items": [
                  {
                      'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                      'deleted': True,
                  },
                  {
                      'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
                      'deleted': False,
                  }
              ]
            }
        )
        return jsonify(invoice)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





## Optional: Display the customer payment method [Client and Server]

Displaying the brand and last four digits of your customer’s card can help them know which card is being charged or if they need to update their payment method.

On the front end, send the payment method ID to a back end endpoint that retrieves the payment method details.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/retrieve-customer-payment-method', methods=['POST'])
def retrieveCustomerPaymentMethod():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        paymentMethod = stripe.PaymentMethod.retrieve(
            data['paymentMethodId'],
        )
        return jsonify(paymentMethod)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```

> We recommend that you save the `paymentMethod.id` and `last4` in your database, for example, `paymentMethod.id` as `stripeCustomerPaymentMethodId` in your `users` collection or table. You can optionally store `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `fingerprint`, `billing_details` as needed. This is to limit the number of calls you make to Stripe, for performance efficiency and to avoid possible rate limiting.

## Disclose Stripe to your customers

Stripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services. This includes using cookies and IP addresses to identify which Elements a customer saw during a single checkout session. You’re responsible for disclosing and obtaining all rights and consents necessary for Stripe to use data in these ways. For more information, visit our [privacy center](https://stripe.com/legal/privacy-center#as-a-business-user-what-notice-do-i-provide-to-my-end-customers-about-stripe).


# Custom flow

> This is a Custom flow for when platform is web and ui is elements. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?platform=web&ui=elements.
Complexity: 3/5
Customise with the [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).

Use the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) to create a custom payment form that you embed in your application to collect payments.

See the [Embedded components quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart-checkout-sessions.md) to learn how to use the Checkout API to create and manage your overall payment flow.

Use this guide to learn how to sell fixed-price *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). You’ll use the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) to create a custom payment form that you embed in your application.

If you don’t want to build a custom payment form, you can integrate with Checkout. For an immersive version of that end-to-end integration guide, see the [Billing quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/quickstart.md).

If you aren’t ready to code an integration, you can set up basic subscriptions [manually in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/subscriptions.md). You can also use [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links.md) to set up subscriptions without writing any code. Learn more about [designing an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/design-an-integration.md) to understand the decisions you need to make and the resources you need.

## What you’ll build

This guide shows you how to:

- Build a product catalogue.
- Build a registration process that creates a customer.
- Create subscriptions and collect payment information.
- Test and monitor payment and subscription status.
- Let customers change their plan or cancel the subscription.
- Learn how to use [flexible billing mode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md) to access enhanced billing behaviour and additional features.

## How to build on Stripe

[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md) simplify your billing by automatically creating *Invoices* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) and [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) for you. To create and activate a subscription, you need to first create a *Product* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) to define what you’re selling and a *Price* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions), which determines the amount to charge and how often. You also need a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) to store the *PaymentMethods* (PaymentMethods represent your customer's payment instruments, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs) used to make each recurring payment.

Use the Customer object associated with a subscription to make and track recurring charges and to manage the products that they subscribe to.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Entitlement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/active-entitlement.md) | Represents a customer’s access to a feature included in a service product that they subscribe to. When you create a subscription for a customer’s recurring purchase of a product, an active entitlement is automatically created for each feature associated with that product. When a customer accesses your services, use their active entitlements to enable the features included in their subscription. |
| [Feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/feature.md)                | Represents a function or ability that your customers can access when they subscribe to a service product. You can include features in a product by creating ProductFeatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices.md)                            | A statement of amounts a customer owes that tracks payment statuses from draft to paid or otherwise finalised. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md)               | A way to build dynamic payment flows. A PaymentIntent tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods. Invoices automatically create PaymentIntents.                                                                                                          |
| [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md)               | A customer’s payment methods that they use to pay for your products. For example, you can store a credit card on a Customer object and use it to make recurring payments for that customer. Typically, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices.md)                                | Defines the unit price, currency, and billing cycle for a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products.md)                            | Goods or services that your business sells. A service product can include one or more features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [ProductFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/product-feature.md)              | Represents a single feature’s inclusion in a single product. Each product is associated with a ProductFeature for each feature that it includes, and each feature is associated with a ProductFeature for each product that includes it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md)                  | Represents a customer’s scheduled recurring purchase of a product. Use a subscription to collect payments and provide repeated delivery of or continuous access to a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Here’s an example of how products, features and entitlements work together. Imagine that you want to set up a recurring service that offers two tiers: a standard product with basic functionality and an advanced product that adds extended functionality.

1. You create two features: `basic_features` and `extended_features`.
1. You create two products: `standard_product` and `advanced_product`.
1. For the standard product, you create one ProductFeature that associates `basic_features` with `standard_product`.
1. For the advanced product, you create two ProductFeatures: one that associates `basic_features` with `advanced_product` and one that associates `extended_features` with `advanced_product`.

A customer, `first_customer`, subscribes to the standard product. When you create the subscription, Stripe automatically creates an Entitlement that associates `first_customer` with `basic_features`.

Another customer, `second_customer`, subscribes to the advanced product. When you create the Subscription, Stripe automatically creates two Entitlements: one that associates `second_customer` with `basic_features`, and one that associates `second_customer` with `extended_features`.

You can determine which features to provision for a customer by [retrieving their active entitlements or listening to the Active Entitlement Summary event](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md#entitlements). You don’t have to retrieve their subscriptions, products, and features.

## Set up Stripe

Install the Stripe client of your choice:



#### Python

```bash
# Install through pip
pip3 install --upgrade stripe
```

```bash
# Or find the Stripe package on http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stripe/
```

```python
# Find the version you want to pin:
# https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
# Specify that version in your requirements.txt file
stripe>=5.0.0
```

```bash
# Or download the source directly: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php/releases
```

```xml
<!--
  For Maven, add the following dependency to your POM and replace with the
  version number you want to use from:
  - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.stripe/stripe-java or
  - https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java/releases/latest
-->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.stripe</groupId>
  <artifactId>stripe-java</artifactId>
  <version>30.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```bash
# For other environments, manually install the following JARs:
# - The Stripe JAR from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java/releases/latest
# - Google Gson from https://github.com/google/gson
```

Next, install the Stripe CLI. The CLI provides webhook testing and you can run it to make API calls to Stripe. This guide shows how to use the CLI to set up a pricing model in a later section.
For additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).
## Create the pricing model [Stripe CLI or Dashboard]

Build the [pricing model](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md) with *Products* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions).

## Create the Customer [Client and Server]

Stripe needs a *Customer* (Customer objects represent customers of your business. They let you reuse payment methods and give you the ability to track multiple payments) for each subscription. In your application front end, collect any necessary information from your users and pass it to the back end.

If you need to collect address details, the Address Element enables you to collect a shipping or billing address for your customers. For more information on the Address Element, see the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element.md) page.

```html
<form id="signup-form">
  <label>
    Email
    <input id="email" type="email" placeholder="Email address" value="test@example.com" required />
  </label>

  <button type="submit">
    Register
  </button>
</form>
```



On the server, create the Stripe Customer object.

> Make sure you store the [Customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-id) to use in the Checkout Session

    country: 'US',
    line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',
    postal_code: '97712',
    state: 'CA',
  },
});
```





## Create the Subscription. [Client and Server]

> If you want to render the Payment Element without first creating a subscription, see [Collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?type=subscription).

Allow your customer to choose a plan and then create the subscription. In the example in this guide, the customer chooses between a Basic plan or Premium plan.

On the front end, pass the selected price ID and the customer record ID to the back end.



On the back end, create the subscription with an `incomplete` status using `payment_behaviour=default_incomplete`. Then, return the `client_secret` from the subscription’s first [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents.md) to the front end to complete payment. To do so, expand the [confirmation_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-confirmation_secret) on the latest invoice of the subscription.

To enable [improved subscription behaviour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md), set `billing_mode[type]` to `flexible`. You must use the Stripe API version [2025-06-30.basil](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/basil.md#2025-06-30.basil) or later.

Set [save_default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method) to `on_subscription` to save the payment method as the default for a subscription when a payment succeeds. Saving a default payment method increases the success rate of future subscription payments.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def create_subscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    customer_id = data['customerId']
    price_id = data['priceId']

    try:
        # Create the subscription. Note we're expanding the Subscription's
        # latest invoice and that invoice's confirmation_secret
        # so we can pass it to the front end to confirm the payment
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.create(
            customer=customer_id,
            items=[{
                'price': price_id,
            }],
            payment_behavior='default_incomplete',
            payment_settings={'save_default_payment_method': 'on_subscription'},
            billing_mode={'type': 'flexible'},
            expand=['latest_invoice.confirmation_secret'],
        )
        return jsonify(subscriptionId=subscription.id, clientSecret=subscription.latest_invoice.confirmation_secret.client_secret)

    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error={'message': e.user_message}), 400
```



> If you’re using a *multi-currency price* (A single Price object can support multiple currencies. Each purchase uses one of the supported currencies for the Price, depending on how you use the Price in your integration), use the [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create.md#create_subscription-currency) parameter to tell the subscription which of the supported currencies to use. If you omit the `currency` parameter, the subscription uses the default currency.

The Subscription is now `inactive` and awaiting payment. The example response below highlights the minimum fields to store, but you can store the fields that your application frequently accesses.

## Collect payment information [Client]

Use [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements.md) to collect payment details and activate the subscription. You can customise Elements to match the look and feel of your application.

The [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) supports [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link.md), credit cards, SEPA Direct Debit and BECS Direct Debit for subscriptions. You can display the enabled payment methods and securely collect payment details based on your customer’s selection.

### Set up Stripe Elements

The Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.

```html
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/clover/stripe.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- content here -->
</body>
```

Create an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your payment page:



### Add the Payment Element to your page

The Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form.

```html
<form id="payment-form">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>
  <button id="submit">Subscribe</button>
  <div id="error-message">
    <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->
  </div>
</form>
```

After the form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node. When you [created the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions.md#create-subscription), you passed the `client_secret` value to the front end. Pass this value as an option when you create an instance of Elements.



The Payment Element renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to select a payment method. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method that they select.

#### Optional Payment Element configurations

You can optionally do the following:

- Customise the Payment Element to match the design of your site by passing the [appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create#stripe_elements-options-appearance) into `options` when creating an instance of Elements.
- Configure the Apple Pay interface to return a [merchant token](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens.md?pay-element=web-pe) to support recurring, automatic reload and deferred payments.

### Complete payment

Use `stripe.confirmPayment` to complete the payment using details from the Payment Element and activate the subscription. This creates a PaymentMethod, confirms the incomplete subscription’s first PaymentIntent and makes a charge. If *Strong Customer Authentication* (Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a regulatory requirement in effect as of September 14, 2019, that impacts many European online payments. It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase) (SCA) is required for the payment, the Payment Element handles the authentication process before confirming the PaymentIntent.

Provide a [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-return_url) to indicate where Stripe redirects the user after they complete the payment. Your user might redirect to an intermediate site first, such as a bank authorisation page, before redirecting to the `return_url`. Card payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful.



When your customer submits a payment, Stripe redirects them to the `return_url` and includes the following URL query parameters. The return page can use them to get the status of the PaymentIntent so it can display the payment status to the customer.

When you specify the `return_url`, you can also append your own query parameters for use on the return page.

| Parameter                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_intent`               | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. For subscription integrations, this client_secret is also exposed on the `Invoice` object through [`confirmation_secret`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-confirmation_secret) |

When the customer is redirected back to your site, you can use the `payment_intent_client_secret` to query for the PaymentIntent and display the transaction status to your customer.

> If you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need to add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause some tools to create new sessions, which prevents you from tracking the complete session.

Use one of the query parameters to retrieve the PaymentIntent. Inspect the [status of the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle.md) to decide what to show your customers. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect process.



## Listen for webhooks [Server]

To complete the integration, you need to process *webhooks* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) sent by Stripe. These events trigger whenever the status in Stripe changes, such as subscriptions creating new invoices. In your application, set up an HTTP handler to accept a POST request containing the webhook event and verify the signature of the event:

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_received():
  # You can use webhooks to receive information about asynchronous payment events.
  # For more about our webhook events check out https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks.
  webhook_secret = os.getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
  request_data = json.loads(request.data)

  if webhook_secret:
    # Retrieve the event by verifying the signature using the raw body and secret if webhook signing is configured.
    signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')
    try:
      event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
        payload=request.data, sig_header=signature, secret=webhook_secret)
      data = event['data']
    except Exception as e:
      return e
    # Get the type of webhook event sent - used to check the status of PaymentIntents.
    event_type = event['type']
  else:
    data = request_data['data']
    event_type = request_data['type']

  data_object = data['object']

  if event_type == 'invoice.paid':
    # Used to provision services after the trial has ended.
    # The status of the invoice shows up as paid. Store the status in your
    # database to reference when a user accesses your service to avoid hitting rate
    # limits.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'invoice.payment_failed':
    # If the payment fails or the customer doesn't have a valid payment method,
    # an invoice.payment_failed event is sent and the subscription becomes past_due.
    # Use this webhook to notify your user that their payment has
    # failed and to retrieve new card details.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'customer.subscription.deleted':
    # handle subscription canceled automatically based
    # upon your subscription settings. Or if the user cancels it.
    print(data)

  return jsonify({'status': 'success'})
```



During development, use the Stripe CLI to [observe webhooks and forward them to your application](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook). Run the following in a new terminal while your development app is running:

#### curl

```bash
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

For production, set up a webhook endpoint in [Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench.md) or use the [Webhook Endpoints API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints.md).

Listen to a few events to complete the remaining steps in this guide. See [Subscription events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md#events) for more details about subscription-specific webhooks.

## Provision access to your service [Client and Server]

Now that the subscription is active, give your user access to your service.  To do this, listen to the `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated` and `customer.subscription.deleted` events. These events pass a `Subscription` object that contains a `status` field indicating whether the subscription is active, past due or cancelled. See [the subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md#subscription-lifecycle) for a complete list of statuses.

In your webhook handler:

1. Verify the subscription status. If it’s `active`, your user has paid for your product.
1. Check the product the customer subscribed to and grant access to your service. Checking the product instead of the price gives you more flexibility if you need to change the pricing or billing period.
1. Store the `product.id`, `subscription.id` and `subscription.status` in your database along with the `customer.id` you already saved. Check this record when determining which features to enable for the user in your application.

The subscription status might change at any point during its lifetime, even if your application doesn’t directly make any calls to Stripe. For example, a renewal might fail because of an expired credit card, which puts the subscription into a `past due` status.  Or, if you implement the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md), a user might cancel their subscription without directly visiting your application. Implementing your handler correctly keeps your application status in sync with Stripe.

## Cancel the subscription [Client and Server]

You can allow customers to cancel their subscriptions. The example below adds a cancellation option to the account settings page.
![Sample subscription cancellation interface](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fixed-price-subscriptions-guide-account-settings.6559626ba4b434826a67abfea165e097.png)

Account settings with the ability to cancel the subscription



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/cancel-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def cancelSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
         # Cancel the subscription by deleting it
        deletedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.delete(data['subscriptionId'])
        return jsonify(deletedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your application receives a `customer.subscription.deleted` event.

After the subscription is cancelled, update your database to remove the Stripe subscription ID you previously stored and limit access to your service.

When a subscription is cancelled, it can’t be reactivated. Instead, collect updated billing information from your customer, update their default payment method and create a new subscription with their existing customer record.

## Test your integration

### Monitor events

Set up webhooks to listen to subscription change events, such as upgrades and cancellations. Learn more about [subscription webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md). You can view events in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events) or with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook).

For more details, see [testing your Billing integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing.md).

## Optional: Let customers change their plans [Client and Server]

To let your customers change their subscription, collect the price ID of the option they want to change to. Then, send the new price ID from the front end to a back end endpoint. The example below also passes the subscription ID, but you can retrieve it from your database for your logged in user.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call, passing the subscription ID and the new price ID. The subscription is now Premium at 15 USD per month, instead of Basic at 5 USD per month.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/update-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def updateSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        updatedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.modify(
            data['subscriptionId'],
            cancel_at_period_end=False,
            items=[{
                'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
            }]
        )
        return jsonify(updatedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your application receives a `customer.subscription.updated` event.

## Optional: Preview a price change [Client and Server]

When your customer changes their subscription, there’s often an adjustment to the amount they owe, known as a [proration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md). You can use the [create preview invoice endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview.md) to display the adjusted amount to your customers.

On the front end, pass the `create preview invoice` details to a back end endpoint.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-preview-invoice', methods=['POST'])
def createPreviewInvoice():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        # Retrieve the subscription
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        # Retrieve the invoice
        invoice = stripe.Invoice.create_preview(
            customer=data['customerId'],
            subscription=data['subscriptionId'],
            subscription_details={
              "items": [
                  {
                      'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                      'deleted': True,
                  },
                  {
                      'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
                      'deleted': False,
                  }
              ]
            }
        )
        return jsonify(invoice)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





## Optional: Display the customer payment method [Client and Server]

Displaying the brand and last four digits of your customer’s card can help them know which card is being charged or if they need to update their payment method.

On the front end, send the payment method ID to a back end endpoint that retrieves the payment method details.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/retrieve-customer-payment-method', methods=['POST'])
def retrieveCustomerPaymentMethod():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        paymentMethod = stripe.PaymentMethod.retrieve(
            data['paymentMethodId'],
        )
        return jsonify(paymentMethod)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```

> We recommend that you save the `paymentMethod.id` and `last4` in your database, for example, `paymentMethod.id` as `stripeCustomerPaymentMethodId` in your `users` collection or table. You can optionally store `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `fingerprint`, `billing_details` as needed. This limits the number of calls you make to Stripe, for performance efficiency and to avoid possible rate limiting.

## Disclose Stripe to your customers

Stripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services. This includes using cookies and IP addresses to identify which Elements a customer saw during a single checkout session. You’re responsible for disclosing and obtaining all rights and consents necessary for Stripe to use data in these ways.

# iOS

> This is a iOS for when platform is ios. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?platform=ios.

Learn how to sell fixed-price *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). You’ll use the [Mobile Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md) to create a custom payment form that you embed in your app.

> If you’re selling digital products or services that are consumed within your app (for example, subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use Apple’s in-app purchase APIs. This rule has some exceptions, including one-to-one personal services and [apps based in specific regions](https://support.stripe.com/questions/changes-to-mobile-app-store-rules). See the [App Store review guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) for more information.

## Build your subscription

This guide shows you how to:

- Model your business by building a product catalogue.
- Create a registration process to add customers.
- Create subscriptions and collect payment information.
- Test and monitor the status of payments and subscriptions.
- Let customers change their plan or cancel the subscription.
- Learn how to use [flexible billing mode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md) to access enhanced billing behaviour and additional features.

## How to model it on Stripe

[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md) simplify your billing by automatically creating *Invoices* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) and [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) for you.  To create and activate a subscription, you need to first create a *Product* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) to model what is being sold, and a *Price* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions) which determines the interval and amount to charge. You also need a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) to store *PaymentMethods* (PaymentMethods represent your customer's payment instruments, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs) used to make each recurring payment.

| [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md)                          | Represents a customer who purchases a subscription. Use the Customer object associated with a subscription to make and track recurring charges and to manage the products that they subscribe to.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Entitlement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/active-entitlement.md) | Represents a customer’s access to a feature included in a service product that they subscribe to. When you create a subscription for a customer’s recurring purchase of a product, an active entitlement is automatically created for each feature associated with that product. When a customer accesses your services, use their active entitlements to enable the features included in their subscription. |
| [Feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/feature.md)                | Represents a function or ability that your customers can access when they subscribe to a service product. You can include features in a product by creating ProductFeatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices.md)                            | A statement of amounts a customer owes that tracks payment statuses from draft to paid or otherwise finalised. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md)               | A way to build dynamic payment flows. A PaymentIntent tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods. Invoices automatically create PaymentIntents.                                                                                                          |
| [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md)               | A customer’s payment methods that they use to pay for your products. For example, you can store a credit card on a Customer object and use it to make recurring payments for that customer. Typically, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices.md)                                | Defines the unit price, currency, and billing cycle for a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products.md)                            | Goods or services that your business sells. A service product can include one or more features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [ProductFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/product-feature.md)              | Represents a single feature’s inclusion in a single product. Each product is associated with a ProductFeature for each feature that it includes, and each feature is associated with a ProductFeature for each product that includes it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md)                  | Represents a customer’s scheduled recurring purchase of a product. Use a subscription to collect payments and provide repeated delivery of or continuous access to a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Here’s an example of how products, features and entitlements work together. Imagine that you want to set up a recurring service that offers two tiers: a standard product with basic functionality and an advanced product that adds extended functionality.

1. You create two features: `basic_features` and `extended_features`.
1. You create two products: `standard_product` and `advanced_product`.
1. For the standard product, you create one ProductFeature that associates `basic_features` with `standard_product`.
1. For the advanced product, you create two ProductFeatures: one that associates `basic_features` with `advanced_product` and one that associates `extended_features` with `advanced_product`.

A customer, `first_customer`, subscribes to the standard product. When you create the subscription, Stripe automatically creates an Entitlement that associates `first_customer` with `basic_features`.

Another customer, `second_customer`, subscribes to the advanced product. When you create the Subscription, Stripe automatically creates two Entitlements: one that associates `second_customer` with `basic_features`, and one that associates `second_customer` with `extended_features`.

You can determine which features to provision for a customer by [retrieving their active entitlements or listening to the Active Entitlement Summary event](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md#entitlements). You don’t have to retrieve their subscriptions, products, and features.

## Set up Stripe

The [Stripe iOS SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios) is open source, [fully documented](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/index.html), and compatible with apps supporting iOS 13 or above.

#### Swift Package Manager

To install the SDK, follow these steps:

1. In Xcode, select **File** > **Add Package Dependencies…** and enter `https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios-spm` as the repository URL.
1. Select the latest version number from our [releases page](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases).
1. Add the **StripePaymentSheet** product to the [target of your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

#### CocoaPods

1. If you haven’t already, install the latest version of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
1. If you don’t have an existing [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html), run the following command to create one:
   ```bash
   pod init
   ```
1. Add this line to your `Podfile`:
   ```podfile
   pod 'StripePaymentSheet'
   ```
1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pod install
   ```
1. Don’t forget to use the `.xcworkspace` file to open your project in Xcode, instead of the `.xcodeproj` file, from here on out.
1. In the future, to update to the latest version of the SDK, run:
   ```bash
   pod update StripePaymentSheet
   ```

#### Carthage

1. If you haven’t already, install the latest version of [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).
1. Add this line to your `Cartfile`:
   ```cartfile
   github "stripe/stripe-ios"
   ```
1. Follow the [Carthage installation instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos). Make sure to embed all of the required frameworks listed [here](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/master/StripePaymentSheet/README.md#manual-linking).
1. In the future, to update to the latest version of the SDK, run the following command:
   ```bash
   carthage update stripe-ios --platform ios
   ```

#### Manual Framework

1. Head to our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases/latest) and download and unzip **Stripe.xcframework.zip**.
1. Drag **StripePaymentSheet.xcframework** to the **Embedded Binaries** section of the **General** settings in your Xcode project. Make sure to select **Copy items if needed**.
1. Repeat step 2 for all required frameworks listed [here](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/master/StripePaymentSheet/README.md#manual-linking).
1. In the future, to update to the latest version of our SDK, repeat steps 1–3.

> For details on the latest SDK release and past versions, see the [Releases](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases) page on GitHub. To receive notifications when a new release is published, [watch releases](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-releases-for-a-repository#watching-releases-for-a-repository) for the repository.

Configure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) on app start. This enables your app to make requests to the Stripe API.

#### Swift



#### Objective-C

```objc
#import "AppDelegate.h"@import StripeCore;

@implementation AppDelegate
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {[StripeAPI setDefaultPublishableKey:@"<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>"];
    // do any other necessary launch configuration
    return YES;
}
@end
```

> Use your [test keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.

And then install the Stripe CLI. The CLI provides webhook testing and you can run it to make API calls to Stripe.  This guide shows how to use the CLI to set up a pricing model in a later section.
For additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).
## Create the pricing model [Stripe CLI or Dashboard]

Build the pricing model with *Products* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions). Read the docs to learn more about [pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md).

## Create the customer [Client and Server]

Stripe needs a *customer* (Customer objects represent customers of your business. They let you reuse payment methods and give you the ability to track multiple payments) for each subscription.  In your application frontend, collect any necessary information from your users and pass it to the back end.

If you need to collect address details, the Address Element enables you to collect a shipping or billing address for your customers. For more information on the Address Element, visit the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element.md) page.



On the server, create the Stripe customer object.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} \
  -d name={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "shipping[address][city]"=Brothers \
  -d "shipping[address][country]"=US \
  -d "shipping[address][line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "shipping[address][postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "shipping[address][state]"=CA \
  -d "shipping[name]"={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "address[city]"=Brothers \
  -d "address[country]"=US \
  -d "address[line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "address[postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "address[state]"=CA
```

```cli
stripe customers create  \
  --email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} \
  --name={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "shipping[address][city]"=Brothers \
  -d "shipping[address][country]"=US \
  -d "shipping[address][line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "shipping[address][postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "shipping[address][state]"=CA \
  -d "shipping[name]"={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "address[city]"=Brothers \
  -d "address[country]"=US \
  -d "address[line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "address[postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "address[state]"=CA
```



```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
customer = client.v1.customers.create({
  "email": "{{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}",
  "name": "{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}",
  "shipping": {
    "address": {
      "city": "Brothers",
      "country": "US",
      "line1": "27 Fredrick Ave",
      "postal_code": "97712",
      "state": "CA",
    },
    "name": "{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}",
  },
  "address": {
    "city": "Brothers",
    "country": "US",
    "line1": "27 Fredrick Ave",
    "postal_code": "97712",
    "state": "CA",
  },
})
```





```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
  email: '{{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}',
  name: '{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}',
  shipping: {
    address: {
      city: 'Brothers',
      country: 'US',
      line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',
      postal_code: '97712',
      state: 'CA',
    },
    name: '{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}',
  },
  address: {
    city: 'Brothers',
    country: 'US',
    line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',
    postal_code: '97712',
    state: 'CA',
  },
});
```





## Create the subscription [Client and Server]

> If you want to render the Payment Element without first creating a subscription, see [Collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?type=subscription).

Let your new customer choose a plan and then create the subscription – in this guide, they choose between Basic and Premium.

In your app, pass the selected price ID and the ID of the customer record to the backend.



On the back end, create the subscription with status `incomplete` using `payment_behavior=default_incomplete`. Then return the `client_secret` from the subscription’s first [payment intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents.md) to the front end to complete payment by expanding the[`confirmation_secret`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-confirmation_secret) on the latest invoice of the subscription.

To enable [improved subscription behaviour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md), set `billing_mode[type]` to `flexible`. You must use Stripe API version [2025-06-30.basil](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/basil.md#2025-06-30.basil) or later.

Set [save_default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method) to `on_subscription` to save the payment method as the default for a subscription when a payment succeeds. Saving a default payment method increases the success rate of future subscription payments.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def create_subscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    customer_id = data['customerId']
    price_id = data['priceId']

    try:
        # Create the subscription. Note we're expanding the Subscription's
        # latest invoice and that invoice's confirmation_secret
        # so we can pass it to the front end to confirm the payment
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.create(
            customer=customer_id,
            items=[{
                'price': price_id,
            }],
            payment_behavior='default_incomplete',
            payment_settings={'save_default_payment_method': 'on_subscription'},
            billing_mode={'type': 'flexible'},
            expand=['latest_invoice.confirmation_secret'],
        )
        return jsonify(subscriptionId=subscription.id, clientSecret=subscription.latest_invoice.confirmation_secret.client_secret)

    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error={'message': e.user_message}), 400
```



> If you’re using a *multi-currency Price* (A single Price object can support multiple currencies. Each purchase uses one of the supported currencies for the Price, depending on how you use the Price in your integration), use the [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create.md#create_subscription-currency) parameter to tell the Subscription which of the Price’s currencies to use. (If you omit the `currency` parameter, then the Subscription uses the Price’s default currency.)

At this point the Subscription is `inactive` and awaiting payment. Here’s an example response. The minimum fields to store are highlighted, but store whatever your application frequently accesses.

## Collect payment information [Client]

Use the [Payment Sheet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/in-app-payment-sheet.md) to collect payment details and activate the subscription. You can customise Elements to match the look and feel of your application.

The Payment Sheet securely collects all necessary payment details for a wide variety of payments methods. Learn about the [supported payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#product-support) for Payment Sheet and Subscriptions.

### Add the Payment Element to your app

> This step shows one way to get started, but you can use any [in-app payments integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/integration.md).

Initialise and present the Mobile Payment Element using the PaymentSheet class.



The Mobile Payment Element renders a sheet that allows your customer to select a payment method. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method that they select.

Setting `allowsDelayedPaymentMethods` to true allows [delayed notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) payment methods like US bank accounts. For these payment methods, the final payment status isn’t known when the `PaymentSheet` completes, and instead succeeds or fails later. If you support these types of payment methods, inform the customer their order is confirmed and only fulfil their order (for example, ship their product) when the payment is successful.

You can customise the Payment Element to match the design of your app by using the [`appearance` property](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md?platform=ios) your `PaymentSheet.Configuration` object.

### Confirm payment

The Mobile Payment Element creates a PaymentMethod and confirms the incomplete Subscription’s first PaymentIntent, causing a charge to be made. If *Strong Customer Authentication* (Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a regulatory requirement in effect as of September 14, 2019, that impacts many European online payments. It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase) (SCA) is required for the payment, the Payment Element handles the authentication process before confirming the PaymentIntent.

## Set up a return URL [Client-side]

The customer might navigate away from your app to authenticate (for example, in Safari or their banking app). To allow them to automatically return to your app after authenticating, [configure a custom URL scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) and set up your app delegate to forward the URL to the SDK. Stripe doesn’t support [universal links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content).

#### SceneDelegate

#### Swift



#### AppDelegate

#### Swift



#### SwiftUI

#### Swift



Additionally, set the [returnURL](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripe-paymentsheet/Classes/PaymentSheet/Configuration.html#/s:6Stripe12PaymentSheetC13ConfigurationV9returnURLSSSgvp) on your [PaymentSheet.Configuration](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripe-paymentsheet/Classes/PaymentSheet/Configuration.html) object to the URL for your app.



## Optional: Enable Apple Pay

### Register for an Apple Merchant ID

Obtain an Apple Merchant ID by [registering for a new identifier](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/merchant) on the Apple Developer website.

Fill out the form with a description and identifier. Your description is for your own records and you can modify it in the future. Stripe recommends using the name of your app as the identifier (for example, `merchant.com.{{YOUR_APP_NAME}}`).

### Create a new Apple Pay certificate

Create a certificate for your app to encrypt payment data.

Go to the [iOS Certificate Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/ios_certificates) in the Dashboard, click **Add new application**, and follow the guide.

Download a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file to get a secure certificate from Apple that allows you to use Apple Pay.

One CSR file must be used to issue exactly one certificate. If you switch your Apple Merchant ID, you must go to the [iOS Certificate Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/ios_certificates) in the Dashboard to obtain a new CSR and certificate.

### Integrate with Xcode

Add the Apple Pay capability to your app. In Xcode, open your project settings, click the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, and add the **Apple Pay** capability. You might be prompted to log in to your developer account at this point. Select the merchant ID you created earlier, and your app is ready to accept Apple Pay.

Enable the Apple Pay capability in Xcode

### Add Apple Pay

#### Recurring payments

To add Apple Pay to PaymentSheet, set [applePay](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripe-paymentsheet/Classes/PaymentSheet/Configuration.html#/s:6Stripe12PaymentSheetC13ConfigurationV8applePayAC05ApplefD0VSgvp) after initialising `PaymentSheet.Configuration` with your Apple merchant ID and the [country code of your business](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account).

As per [Apple’s guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pay#Supporting-subscriptions) for recurring payments, you must also set additional attributes on the `PKPaymentRequest`. Add a handler in [ApplePayConfiguration.paymentRequestHandlers](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripepaymentsheet/documentation/stripepaymentsheet/paymentsheet/applepayconfiguration/handlers/paymentrequesthandler) to configure the [PKPaymentRequest.paymentSummaryItems](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentrequest/1619231-paymentsummaryitems) with the amount you intend to charge (for example, 9.95 USD a month).

You can also adopt [merchant tokens](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens/) by setting the `recurringPaymentRequest` or `automaticReloadPaymentRequest` properties on the `PKPaymentRequest`.

To learn more about how to use recurring payments with Apple Pay, see [Apple’s PassKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentrequest).

### Order tracking

To add [order tracking](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/technologies/wallet/designing-order-tracking) information in iOS 16 or later, configure an [authorizationResultHandler](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripepaymentsheet/documentation/stripepaymentsheet/paymentsheet/applepayconfiguration/handlers/authorizationresulthandler) in your `PaymentSheet.ApplePayConfiguration.Handlers`. Stripe calls your implementation after the payment is complete, but before iOS dismisses the Apple Pay sheet.

In your `authorizationResultHandler` implementation, fetch the order details from your server for the completed order. Add the details to the provided [PKPaymentAuthorizationResult](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentauthorizationresult) and call the provided completion handler.

To learn more about order tracking, see [Apple’s Wallet Orders documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletorders).

## Listen for webhooks [Server]

To complete the integration, you need to process *webhooks* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) sent by Stripe. These are events triggered whenever state inside of Stripe changes, such as subscriptions creating new invoices. In your application, set up an HTTP handler to accept a POST request containing the webhook event, and verify the signature of the event:

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_received():
  # You can use webhooks to receive information about asynchronous payment events.
  # For more about our webhook events check out https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks.
  webhook_secret = os.getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
  request_data = json.loads(request.data)

  if webhook_secret:
    # Retrieve the event by verifying the signature using the raw body and secret if webhook signing is configured.
    signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')
    try:
      event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
        payload=request.data, sig_header=signature, secret=webhook_secret)
      data = event['data']
    except Exception as e:
      return e
    # Get the type of webhook event sent - used to check the status of PaymentIntents.
    event_type = event['type']
  else:
    data = request_data['data']
    event_type = request_data['type']

  data_object = data['object']

  if event_type == 'invoice.paid':
    # Used to provision services after the trial has ended.
    # The status of the invoice will show up as paid. Store the status in your
    # database to reference when a user accesses your service to avoid hitting rate
    # limits.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'invoice.payment_failed':
    # If the payment fails or the customer does not have a valid payment method,
    # an invoice.payment_failed event is sent, the subscription becomes past_due.
    # Use this webhook to notify your user that their payment has
    # failed and to retrieve new card details.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'customer.subscription.deleted':
    # handle subscription canceled automatically based
    # upon your subscription settings. Or if the user cancels it.
    print(data)

  return jsonify({'status': 'success'})
```



During development, use the Stripe CLI to [observe webhooks and forward them to your application](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook). Run the following in a new terminal while your development app is running:

#### curl

```bash
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

For production, set up a webhook endpoint URL in the Dashboard, or use the [Webhook Endpoints API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints.md).

You need to listen to a few events to complete the remaining steps in this guide. See [Subscription events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md#events) for more details about subscription-specific webhooks.

## Provision access to your service [Client and Server]

Now that the subscription is active, give your user access to your service.  To do this, listen to the `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.  These events pass a subscription object which contains a `status` field indicating whether the subscription is active, overdue, or cancelled.  See [the subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md#subscription-lifecycle) for a complete list of statuses.

In your webhook handler:

1. Verify the subscription status.  If it’s `active` then your user has paid for your product.
1. Check the product the customer subscribed to and grant access to your service. Checking the product instead of the price gives you more flexibility if you need to change the pricing or billing interval.
1. Store the `product.id`, `subscription.id` and `subscription.status` in your database along with the `customer.id` you already saved.  Check this record when determining which features to enable for the user in your application.

The state of a subscription might change at any point during its lifetime, even if your application does not directly make any calls to Stripe.  For example, a renewal might fail due to an expired credit card, which puts the subscription into an overdue state.  Or, if you implement the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md), a user might cancel their subscription without directly visiting your application.  Implementing your handler correctly keeps your application state in sync with Stripe.

## Cancel the subscription [Client and Server]

It’s common to allow customers to cancel their subscriptions. This example adds a cancellation option to the account settings page.

The example collects the subscription ID on the front end, but your application can get this information from your database for your logged-in user.
![Sample subscription cancellation interface.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fixed-price-subscriptions-guide-account-settings.6559626ba4b434826a67abfea165e097.png)

Account settings with the ability to cancel the subscription



On the back end, define the endpoint for your app to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/cancel-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def cancelSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
         # Cancel the subscription by deleting it
        deletedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.delete(data['subscriptionId'])
        return jsonify(deletedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your back end receives a `customer.subscription.deleted` event.

After the subscription is cancelled, update your database to remove the Stripe subscription ID you previously stored, and limit access to your service.

When a subscription is cancelled, it can’t be reactivated. Instead, collect updated billing information from your customer, update their default payment method, and create a new subscription with their existing customer record.

## Test your integration

### Test payment methods

Use the following table to test different payment methods and scenarios.

### Monitor events

Set up webhooks to listen to subscription change events, such as upgrades and cancellations. Learn more about [subscription webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md). You can view events in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events) or with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook).

For more details, see [testing your Billing integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing.md).

## Optional: Let customers change their plans [Client and Server]

To let your customers change their subscription, collect the price ID of the option they want to change to. Then send the new price ID from the app to a back end endpoint. This example also passes the subscription ID, but you can retrieve it from your database for your logged-in user.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call, passing the subscription ID and the new price ID. The subscription is now Premium, at 15 USD per month, instead of Basic at 5 USD per month.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/update-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def updateSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        updatedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.modify(
            data['subscriptionId'],
            cancel_at_period_end=False,
            items=[{
                'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
            }]
        )
        return jsonify(updatedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your application receives a `customer.subscription.updated` event.

## Optional: Preview a price change [Client and Server]

When your customer changes their subscription, there’s often an adjustment to the amount they owe, known as a [proration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md). You can use the [create preview invoice endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview.md) to display the adjusted amount to your customers.

From the app, pass the preview invoice details to a back end endpoint.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-preview-invoice', methods=['POST'])
def createPreviewInvoice():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        # Retrieve the subscription
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        # Retrieve the invoice
        invoice = stripe.Invoice.create_preview(
            customer=data['customerId'],
            subscription=data['subscriptionId'],
            subscription_details={
              "items": [
                  {
                      'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                      'deleted': True,
                  },
                  {
                      'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
                      'deleted': False,
                  }
              ]
            }
        )
        return jsonify(invoice)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





## Optional: Display the customer payment method [Client and Server]

Displaying the brand and last four digits of your customer’s card can help them know which card is being charged, or if they need to update their payment method.

On the front end, send the payment method ID to a back-end endpoint that retrieves the payment method details.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your app to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/retrieve-customer-payment-method', methods=['POST'])
def retrieveCustomerPaymentMethod():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        paymentMethod = stripe.PaymentMethod.retrieve(
            data['paymentMethodId'],
        )
        return jsonify(paymentMethod)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```

> We recommend that you save the `paymentMethod.id` and `last4` in your database, for example, `paymentMethod.id` as `stripeCustomerPaymentMethodId` in your `users` collection or table. You can optionally store `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `fingerprint`, `billing_details` as needed. This is to limit the number of calls you make to Stripe – for both performance efficiency and to avoid possible rate limiting.

## Disclose Stripe to your customers

Stripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services. This includes using cookies and IP addresses to identify which Elements a customer saw during a single checkout session.

Learn how to sell fixed-price *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). You’ll use the [Mobile Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md) to create a custom payment form that you embed in your app.

> If you’re selling digital products or services that are consumed within your app (for example, subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use Apple’s in-app purchase APIs. This rule has some exceptions, including one-to-one personal services and [apps based in specific regions](https://support.stripe.com/questions/changes-to-mobile-app-store-rules). See the [App Store review guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) for more information.

## Build your subscription

This guide shows you how to:

- Model your business by building a product catalogue.
- Create a registration process to add customers.
- Create subscriptions and collect payment information.
- Test and monitor the status of payments and subscriptions.
- Let customers change their plan or cancel the subscription.
- Learn how to use [flexible billing mode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md) to access enhanced billing behaviour and additional features.

## How to model it on Stripe

[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md) simplify your billing by automatically creating *Invoices* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) and [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) for you.  To create and activate a subscription, you need to first create a *Product* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) to model what is being sold, and a *Price* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions) which determines the interval and amount to charge. You also need a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) to store *PaymentMethods* (PaymentMethods represent your customer's payment instruments, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs) used to make each recurring payment.

Each product is associated with a ProductFeature for each feature that it includes, and each feature is associated with a ProductFeature for each product that includes it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md)                  | Represents a customer’s scheduled recurring purchase of a product. Use a subscription to collect payments and provide repeated delivery of or continuous access to a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Here’s an example of how products, features and entitlements work together. Imagine that you want to set up a recurring service that offers two tiers: a standard product with basic functionality and an advanced product that adds extended functionality.

1. You create two features: `basic_features` and `extended_features`.
1. You create two products: `standard_product` and `advanced_product`.
1. For the standard product, you create one ProductFeature that associates `basic_features` with `standard_product`.
1. For the advanced product, you create two ProductFeatures: one that associates `basic_features` with `advanced_product` and one that associates `extended_features` with `advanced_product`.

A customer, `first_customer`, subscribes to the standard product. When you create the subscription, Stripe automatically creates an Entitlement that associates `first_customer` with `basic_features`.

Another customer, `second_customer`, subscribes to the advanced product. When you create the Subscription, Stripe automatically creates two Entitlements: one that associates `second_customer` with `basic_features`, and one that associates `second_customer` with `extended_features`.

You can determine which features to provision for a customer by [retrieving their active entitlements or listening to the Active Entitlement Summary event](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md#entitlements). You don’t have to retrieve their subscriptions, products, and features.

## Set up Stripe

The [Stripe Android SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android) is open source and [fully documented](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/).

To install the SDK, add `stripe-android` to the `dependencies` block of your [app/build.gradle](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies) file:

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
}

android { ... }

dependencies {
  // ...

  // Stripe Android SDK
  implementation("com.stripe:stripe-android:21.28.1")
  // Include the financial connections SDK to support US bank account as a payment method
  implementation("com.stripe:financial-connections:21.28.1")
}
```

#### Groovy

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android { ... }

dependencies {
  // ...

  // Stripe Android SDK
  implementation 'com.stripe:stripe-android:21.28.1'
  // Include the financial connections SDK to support US bank account as a payment method
  implementation 'com.stripe:financial-connections:21.28.1'
}
```

> For details on the latest SDK release and past versions, see the [Releases](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/releases) page on GitHub. To receive notifications when a new release is published, [watch releases for the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository).

Configure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) so that it can make requests to the Stripe API, such as in your `Application` subclass:

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import com.stripe.android.PaymentConfiguration

class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        PaymentConfiguration.init(
            applicationContext,
            "<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>"
        )
    }
}
```

> Use your [test keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.

And then install the Stripe CLI. The CLI provides webhook testing and you can run it to make API calls to Stripe.  This guide shows how to use the CLI to set up a pricing model in a later section.
For additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).
## Create the pricing model [Stripe CLI or Dashboard]

Build the pricing model with *Products* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions). Read the docs to learn more about [pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md).

## Create the customer [Client and Server]

Stripe needs a *customer* (Customer objects represent customers of your business. They let you reuse payment methods and give you the ability to track multiple payments) for each subscription.  In your application frontend, collect any necessary information from your users and pass it to the back end.

You might want to use a Network library to send network requests to your back end. This document uses [okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/), but you can use any library that work best in your project.

```groovy
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation "com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0"
}
```

If you need to collect address details, the Address Element enables you to collect a shipping or billing address for your customers. For more information on the Address Element, visit the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element.md) page.

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column
import androidx.compose.material3.Button
import androidx.compose.material3.OutlinedTextField
import androidx.compose.material3.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue

import kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope
import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch
import okhttp3.MediaType.Companion.toMediaType
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
import okhttp3.Request
import okhttp3.RequestBody.Companion.toRequestBody
import org.json.JSONObject

@Composable
fun RegisterView() {
    var email by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    Column {
        OutlinedTextField(value = email,
            label = { Text(text = "Email") },
            onValueChange = { email = it })
        Button(onClick = {
            val body = JSONObject().put("email", email).toString()
                .toRequestBody("application/json".toMediaType())
            val request =
                Request.Builder().url("http://10.0.2.2:4567/create-customer").post(body).build()
            CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
                OkHttpClient().newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
                    if (response.isSuccessful) {
                        println(JSONObject(response.body!!.string()).get("customer"))
                    }
                }
            }
        }) {
            Text(text = "Submit")
        }
    }
}
```

On the server, create the Stripe customer object.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} \
  -d name={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \

  -d "shipping[address][line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "shipping[address][postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "shipping[address][state]"=CA \
  -d "shipping[name]"={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "address[city]"=Brothers \
  -d "address[country]"=US \
  -d "address[line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "address[postal_code]"=97712 \

```

```cli

```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
customer = client.v1.customers.create({
  "email": "{{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}",
  "name": "{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}",
  "shipping": {
    "address": {
      "city": "Brothers",
      "country": "US",
      "line1": "27 Fredrick Ave",
      "postal_code": "97712",
      "state": "CA",

// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
  email: '{{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}',
  name: '{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}',
  shipping: {
    address: {
      city: 'Brothers',
      country: 'US',
      line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',

    line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',

  },
});
```





## Create the subscription [Client and Server]

> If you want to render the Payment Element without first creating a subscription, see [Collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?type=subscription).

Let your new customer choose a plan and then create the subscription – in this guide, they choose between Basic and Premium.

In your app, pass the selected price ID and the ID of the customer record to the backend.

```kotlin
import okhttp3.MediaType.Companion.toMediaType
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
import okhttp3.Request
import okhttp3.RequestBody.Companion.toRequestBody
import org.json.JSONObject

fun createSubscription(priceId: String, customerId: String): SubscriptionResponse? {
    val body = JSONObject()
        .put("priceId", priceId)
        .put("customerId", customerId).toString()
        .toRequestBody("application/json".toMediaType())
    val request =
        Request.Builder().url("http://10.0.2.2:4567/create-subscription").post(body).build()
    OkHttpClient().newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
        if (response.isSuccessful) {
            // SubscriptionsResponse is data class conforming to the expected response from your backend.
            // It should include the client_secret, as discussed below.
            return Gson().fromJson(response.body!!.string(), SubscriptionResponse::class.java)
        }
    }
    return null
}
```

On the back end, create the subscription with status `incomplete` using `payment_behavior=default_incomplete`. Then return the `client_secret` from the subscription’s first [payment intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents.md) to the front end to complete payment by expanding the[`confirmation_secret`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-confirmation_secret) on the latest invoice of the subscription.

To enable [improved subscription behaviour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md), set `billing_mode[type]` to `flexible`. You must use Stripe API version [2025-06-30.basil](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/basil.md#2025-06-30.basil) or later.

Set [save_default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method) to `on_subscription` to save the payment method as the default for a subscription when a payment succeeds. Saving a default payment method increases the success rate of future subscription payments.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def create_subscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    customer_id = data['customerId']
    price_id = data['priceId']

    try:
        # Create the subscription. Note we're expanding the Subscription's
        # latest invoice and that invoice's confirmation_secret
        # so we can pass it to the front end to confirm the payment
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.create(
            customer=customer_id,
            items=[{
                'price': price_id,
            }],
            payment_behavior='default_incomplete',
            payment_settings={'save_default_payment_method': 'on_subscription'},
            billing_mode={'type': 'flexible'},
            expand=['latest_invoice.confirmation_secret'],
        )
        return jsonify(subscriptionId=subscription.id, clientSecret=subscription.latest_invoice.confirmation_secret.client_secret)

    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error={'message': e.user_message}), 400
```



> If you’re using a *multi-currency Price* (A single Price object can support multiple currencies. Each purchase uses one of the supported currencies for the Price, depending on how you use the Price in your integration), use the [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create.md#create_subscription-currency) parameter to tell the Subscription which of the Price’s currencies to use. (If you omit the `currency` parameter, then the Subscription uses the Price’s default currency.)

At this point the Subscription is `inactive` and awaiting payment. Here’s an example response. The minimum fields to store are highlighted, but store whatever your application frequently accesses.

## Collect payment information [Client]

Use the [Payment Sheet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/in-app-payment-sheet.md) to collect payment details and activate the subscription. You can customise Elements to match the look and feel of your application.

The Payment Sheet securely collects all necessary payment details for a wide variety of payments methods. Learn about the [supported payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#product-support) for Payment Sheet and Subscriptions.

### Add the Payment Element to your app

> This step shows one way to get started, but you can use any [in-app payments integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/integration.md).

Initialise and present the Mobile Payment Element using the PaymentSheet class.

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.material3.Button
import androidx.compose.material3.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import com.stripe.android.paymentsheet.PaymentSheet
import com.stripe.android.paymentsheet.PaymentSheetResult
import com.stripe.android.paymentsheet.rememberPaymentSheet

@Composable
fun SubscribeView(clientSecret: String) {
    val paymentSheet = rememberPaymentSheet(::onPaymentSheetResult)

    Button(onClick = {
        paymentSheet.presentWithPaymentIntent(
            clientSecret, PaymentSheet.Configuration(
                primaryButtonLabel = "Subscribe for $15/month",
                merchantDisplayName = "My merchant name",
                // Set `allowsDelayedPaymentMethods` to true if your business handles
                // delayed notification payment methods like US bank accounts.
                allowsDelayedPaymentMethods = true
            )
        )
    }) {
        Text(text = "Subscribe")
    }
}

fun onPaymentSheetResult(paymentSheetResult: PaymentSheetResult) {
    when (paymentSheetResult) {
        is PaymentSheetResult.Canceled -> {
            print("Canceled")
        }

        is PaymentSheetResult.Failed -> {
            print("Error: ${paymentSheetResult.error}")
        }

        is PaymentSheetResult.Completed -> {
            // Display for example, an order confirmation screen
            print("Completed")
        }
    }
}
```

The Mobile Payment Element renders a sheet that allows your customer to select a payment method. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method that they select.

Setting `allowsDelayedPaymentMethods` to true allows [delayed notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) payment methods like US bank accounts. For these payment methods, the final payment status isn’t known when the `PaymentSheet` completes, and instead succeeds or fails later. If you support these types of payment methods, inform the customer their order is confirmed and only fulfil their order (for example, ship their product) when the payment is successful.

You can customise the Payment Element to match the design of your app by using the [`appearance` property](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md?platform=ios) your `PaymentSheet.Configuration` object.

### Confirm payment

The Mobile Payment Element creates a PaymentMethod and confirms the incomplete Subscription’s first PaymentIntent, causing a charge to be made. If *Strong Customer Authentication* (Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a regulatory requirement in effect as of September 14, 2019, that impacts many European online payments. It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase) (SCA) is required for the payment, the Payment Element handles the authentication process before confirming the PaymentIntent.

## Listen for webhooks [Server]

To complete the integration, you need to process *webhooks* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) sent by Stripe. These are events triggered whenever state inside of Stripe changes, such as subscriptions creating new invoices. In your application, set up an HTTP handler to accept a POST request containing the webhook event, and verify the signature of the event:

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_received():
  # You can use webhooks to receive information about asynchronous payment events.
  # For more about our webhook events check out https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks.
  webhook_secret = os.getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
  request_data = json.loads(request.data)

  if webhook_secret:
    # Retrieve the event by verifying the signature using the raw body and secret if webhook signing is configured.
    signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')
    try:
      event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
        payload=request.data, sig_header=signature, secret=webhook_secret)
      data = event['data']
    except Exception as e:
      return e
    # Get the type of webhook event sent - used to check the status of PaymentIntents.
    event_type = event['type']
  else:
    data = request_data['data']
    event_type = request_data['type']

  data_object = data['object']

  if event_type == 'invoice.paid':
    # Used to provision services after the trial has ended.
    # The status of the invoice will show up as paid. Store the status in your
    # database to reference when a user accesses your service to avoid hitting rate
    # limits.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'invoice.payment_failed':
    # If the payment fails or the customer does not have a valid payment method,
    # an invoice.payment_failed event is sent, the subscription becomes past_due.
    # Use this webhook to notify your user that their payment has
    # failed and to retrieve new card details.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'customer.subscription.deleted':
    # handle subscription canceled automatically based
    # upon your subscription settings. Or if the user cancels it.
    print(data)

  return jsonify({'status': 'success'})
```



During development, use the Stripe CLI to [observe webhooks and forward them to your application](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook). Run the following in a new terminal while your development app is running:

#### curl

```bash
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

For production, set up a webhook endpoint URL in the Dashboard, or use the [Webhook Endpoints API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints.md).

You need to listen to a few events to complete the remaining steps in this guide. See [Subscription events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md#events) for more details about subscription-specific webhooks.

## Provision access to your service [Client and Server]

Now that the subscription is active, give your user access to your service.  To do this, listen to the `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.  These events pass a subscription object which contains a `status` field indicating whether the subscription is active, overdue, or cancelled.  See [the subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md#subscription-lifecycle) for a complete list of statuses.

In your webhook handler:

1. Verify the subscription status.  If it’s `active` then your user has paid for your product.
1. Check the product the customer subscribed to and grant access to your service. Checking the product instead of the price gives you more flexibility if you need to change the pricing or billing interval.
1. Store the `product.id`, `subscription.id` and `subscription.status` in your database along with the `customer.id` you already saved.  Check this record when determining which features to enable for the user in your application.

The state of a subscription might change at any point during its lifetime, even if your application does not directly make any calls to Stripe.  For example, a renewal might fail due to an expired credit card, which puts the subscription into an overdue state.  Or, if you implement the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md), a user might cancel their subscription without directly visiting your application.  Implementing your handler correctly keeps your application state in sync with Stripe.

## Cancel the subscription [Client and Server]

It’s common to allow customers to cancel their subscriptions. This example adds a cancellation option to the account settings page.

The example collects the subscription ID on the front end, but your application can get this information from your database for your logged-in user.
![Sample subscription cancellation interface.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fixed-price-subscriptions-guide-account-settings.6559626ba4b434826a67abfea165e097.png)

Account settings with the ability to cancel the subscription

```kotlin
fun cancelSubscription(subscriptionId: String): SubscriptionResponse? {
    val body = JSONObject().put("subscriptionId", subscriptionId).toString()
        .toRequestBody("application/json".toMediaType())
    val request =
        Request.Builder().url("http://10.0.2.2:4567/cancel-subscription").post(body).build()
    OkHttpClient().newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
        if (response.isSuccessful) {
            return Gson().fromJson(response.body!!.string(), SubscriptionResponse::class.java)
        }
    }
    return null
}
```

On the back end, define the endpoint for your app to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/cancel-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def cancelSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
         # Cancel the subscription by deleting it
        deletedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.delete(data['subscriptionId'])
        return jsonify(deletedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your back end receives a `customer.subscription.deleted` event.

After the subscription is cancelled, update your database to remove the Stripe subscription ID you previously stored, and limit access to your service.

When a subscription is cancelled, it can’t be reactivated. Instead, collect updated billing information from your customer, update their default payment method, and create a new subscription with their existing customer record.

### Monitor events

Set up webhooks to listen to subscription change events, such as upgrades and cancellations. Learn more about [subscription webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md). You can view events in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events) or with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook).

For more details, see [testing your Billing integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing.md).

## Optional: Let customers change their plans [Client and Server]

To let your customers change their subscription, collect the price ID of the option they want to change to. Then send the new price ID from the app to a back end endpoint. This example also passes the subscription ID, but you can retrieve it from your database for your logged-in user.

```kotlin
fun updateSubscription(subscriptionId: String, priceId: String): SubscriptionResponse? {
    val body = JSONObject()
        .put("priceId", priceId)
        .put("subscriptionId", subscriptionId).toString()
        .toRequestBody("application/json".toMediaType())
    val request =
        Request.Builder().url("http://10.0.2.2:4567/update-subscription").post(body).build()
    OkHttpClient().newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
        if (response.isSuccessful) {
            // It should include the client_secret, as discussed below.
            return Gson().fromJson(response.body!!.string(), SubscriptionResponse::class.java)
        }
    }
    return null
}
```

On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call, passing the subscription ID and the new price ID. The subscription is now Premium, at 15 USD per month, instead of Basic at 5 USD per month.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/update-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def updateSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        updatedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.modify(
            data['subscriptionId'],
            cancel_at_period_end=False,
            items=[{
                'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
            }]
        )
        return jsonify(updatedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your application receives a `customer.subscription.updated` event.

## Optional: Preview a price change [Client and Server]

When your customer changes their subscription, there’s often an adjustment to the amount they owe, known as a [proration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md). You can use the [create preview invoice endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview.md) to display the adjusted amount to your customers.

From the app, pass the preview invoice details to a back end endpoint.

```kotlin
fun createPreviewInvoice(
    subscriptionId: String,
    priceId: String,
    newPriceId: String
): InvoiceResponse? {
    val body = JSONObject()
        .put("priceId", priceId)
        .put("subscriptionId", subscriptionId)
        .put("newPriceId", newPriceId).toString()
        .toRequestBody("application/json".toMediaType())
    val request =
        Request.Builder().url("http://10.0.2.2:4567/create-preview-invoice").post(body).build()
    OkHttpClient().newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
        if (response.isSuccessful) {
            // InvoiceResponse is a data class conforming to the expected response from your backend
            return Gson().fromJson(response.body!!.string(), InvoiceResponse::class.java)
        }
    }
    return null
}
```

On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-preview-invoice', methods=['POST'])
def createPreviewInvoice():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        # Retrieve the subscription
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        # Retrieve the invoice
        invoice = stripe.Invoice.create_preview(
            customer=data['customerId'],
            subscription=data['subscriptionId'],
            subscription_details={
              "items": [
                  {
                      'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                      'deleted': True,
                  },
                  {
                      'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
                      'deleted': False,
                  }
              ]
            }
        )
        return jsonify(invoice)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





## Optional: Display the customer payment method [Client and Server]

Displaying the brand and last four digits of your customer’s card can help them know which card is being charged, or if they need to update their payment method.

On the front end, send the payment method ID to a back-end endpoint that retrieves the payment method details.

```kotlin
fun retrieveCustomerPaymentMethod(paymentMethodId: String): PaymentMethodResponse? {
    val body = JSONObject()
        .put("paymentMethodId", paymentMethodId).toString()
        .toRequestBody("application/json".toMediaType())
    val request =
        Request.Builder().url("http://10.0.2.2:4567/retrieve-customer-payment-method").post(body)
            .build()
    OkHttpClient().newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
        if (response.isSuccessful) {
            // PaymentMethodResponse is a data class conforming to the expected response from your backend
            return Gson().fromJson(response.body!!.string(), PaymentMethodResponse::class.java)
        }
    }
    return null
}
```

On the back end, define the endpoint for your app to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/retrieve-customer-payment-method', methods=['POST'])
def retrieveCustomerPaymentMethod():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        paymentMethod = stripe.PaymentMethod.retrieve(
            data['paymentMethodId'],
        )
        return jsonify(paymentMethod)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```

> We recommend that you save the `paymentMethod.id` and `last4` in your database, for example, `paymentMethod.id` as `stripeCustomerPaymentMethodId` in your `users` collection or table. You can optionally store `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `fingerprint`, `billing_details` as needed. This is to limit the number of calls you make to Stripe – for both performance efficiency and to avoid possible rate limiting.

# React Native

> This is a React Native for when platform is react-native. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?platform=react-native.

Learn how to sell fixed-price *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). You’ll use the [Mobile Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md) to create a custom payment form that you embed in your app.

> If you’re selling digital products or services that are consumed within your app (for example, subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use Apple’s in-app purchase APIs. This rule has some exceptions, including one-to-one personal services and [apps based in specific regions](https://support.stripe.com/questions/changes-to-mobile-app-store-rules). See the [App Store review guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) for more information.

## Build your subscription

This guide shows you how to:

- Model your business by building a product catalogue.
- Create a registration process to add customers.
- Create subscriptions and collect payment information.
- Test and monitor the status of payments and subscriptions.
- Let customers change their plan or cancel the subscription.
- Learn how to use [flexible billing mode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md) to access enhanced billing behaviour and additional features.

## How to model it on Stripe

[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md) simplify your billing by automatically creating *Invoices* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) and [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) for you.  To create and activate a subscription, you need to first create a *Product* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) to model what is being sold, and a *Price* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions) which determines the interval and amount to charge. You also need a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) to store *PaymentMethods* (PaymentMethods represent your customer's payment instruments, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs) used to make each recurring payment.

| [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md)                          | Represents a customer who purchases a subscription. Use the Customer object associated with a subscription to make and track recurring charges and to manage the products that they subscribe to.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Entitlement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/active-entitlement.md) | Represents a customer’s access to a feature included in a service product that they subscribe to. When you create a subscription for a customer’s recurring purchase of a product, an active entitlement is automatically created for each feature associated with that product. When a customer accesses your services, use their active entitlements to enable the features included in their subscription. |
| [Feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/feature.md)                | Represents a function or ability that your customers can access when they subscribe to a service product. You can include features in a product by creating ProductFeatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices.md)                            | A statement of amounts a customer owes that tracks payment statuses from draft to paid or otherwise finalised. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md)               | A way to build dynamic payment flows. A PaymentIntent tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods. Invoices automatically create PaymentIntents.                                                                                                          |
| [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md)               | A customer’s payment methods that they use to pay for your products. For example, you can store a credit card on a Customer object and use it to make recurring payments for that customer. Typically, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices.md)                                | Defines the unit price, currency, and billing cycle for a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products.md)                            | Goods or services that your business sells. A service product can include one or more features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [ProductFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/product-feature.md)              | Represents a single feature’s inclusion in a single product. Each product is associated with a ProductFeature for each feature that it includes, and each feature is associated with a ProductFeature for each product that includes it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions.md)                  | Represents a customer’s scheduled recurring purchase of a product. Use a subscription to collect payments and provide repeated delivery of or continuous access to a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Here’s an example of how products, features and entitlements work together. Imagine that you want to set up a recurring service that offers two tiers: a standard product with basic functionality and an advanced product that adds extended functionality.

1. You create two features: `basic_features` and `extended_features`.
1. You create two products: `standard_product` and `advanced_product`.
1. For the standard product, you create one ProductFeature that associates `basic_features` with `standard_product`.
1. For the advanced product, you create two ProductFeatures: one that associates `basic_features` with `advanced_product` and one that associates `extended_features` with `advanced_product`.

A customer, `first_customer`, subscribes to the standard product. When you create the subscription, Stripe automatically creates an Entitlement that associates `first_customer` with `basic_features`.

Another customer, `second_customer`, subscribes to the advanced product. When you create the Subscription, Stripe automatically creates two Entitlements: one that associates `second_customer` with `basic_features`, and one that associates `second_customer` with `extended_features`.

You can determine which features to provision for a customer by [retrieving their active entitlements or listening to the Active Entitlement Summary event](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements.md#entitlements). You don’t have to retrieve their subscriptions, products, and features.

## Set up Stripe

The [React Native SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native) is open source and fully documented. Internally, it uses the [native iOS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android) SDKs. To install Stripe’s React Native SDK, run one of the following commands in your project’s directory (depending on which package manager you use):

#### yarn

```bash
yarn add @stripe/stripe-react-native
```

#### npm

```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native
```

Next, install some other necessary dependencies:

- For iOS, go to the **ios** directory and run `pod install` to ensure that you also install the required native dependencies.
- For Android, there are no more dependencies to install.

> We recommend following the [official TypeScript guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript#adding-typescript-to-an-existing-project) to add TypeScript support.

### Stripe initialisation

To initialise Stripe in your React Native app, either wrap your payment screen with the `StripeProvider` component, or use the `initStripe` initialisation method. Only the API [publishable key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) in `publishableKey` is required. The following example shows how to initialise Stripe using the `StripeProvider` component.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

function App() {
  const [publishableKey, setPublishableKey] = useState('');

  const fetchPublishableKey = async () => {
    const key = await fetchKey(); // fetch key from your server here
    setPublishableKey(key);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPublishableKey();
  }, []);

  return (
    <StripeProvider
      publishableKey={publishableKey}
      merchantIdentifier="merchant.identifier" // required for Apple Pay
      urlScheme="your-url-scheme" // required for 3D Secure and bank redirects
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </StripeProvider>
  );
}
```

> Use your API [test keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.

And then install the Stripe CLI. The CLI provides webhook testing and you can run it to make API calls to Stripe.  This guide shows how to use the CLI to set up a pricing model in a later section.
For additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).
## Create the pricing model [Stripe CLI or Dashboard]

Build the pricing model with *Products* (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions). Read the docs to learn more about [pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md).

## Create the customer [Client and Server]

Stripe needs a *customer* (Customer objects represent customers of your business. They let you reuse payment methods and give you the ability to track multiple payments) for each subscription.  In your application frontend, collect any necessary information from your users and pass it to the back end.

If you need to collect address details, the Address Element enables you to collect a shipping or billing address for your customers. For more information on the Address Element, visit the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element.md) page.



On the server, create the Stripe customer object.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} \
  -d name={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "shipping[address][city]"=Brothers \
  -d "shipping[address][country]"=US \
  -d "shipping[address][line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "shipping[address][postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "shipping[address][state]"=CA \
  -d "shipping[name]"={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "address[city]"=Brothers \
  -d "address[country]"=US \
  -d "address[line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "address[postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "address[state]"=CA
```

```cli
stripe customers create  \
  --email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} \
  --name={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "shipping[address][city]"=Brothers \
  -d "shipping[address][country]"=US \
  -d "shipping[address][line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "shipping[address][postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "shipping[address][state]"=CA \
  -d "shipping[name]"={{CUSTOMER_NAME}} \
  -d "address[city]"=Brothers \
  -d "address[country]"=US \
  -d "address[line1]"="27 Fredrick Ave" \
  -d "address[postal_code]"=97712 \
  -d "address[state]"=CA
```



```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
customer = client.v1.customers.create({
  "email": "{{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}",
  "name": "{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}",
  "shipping": {
    "address": {
      "city": "Brothers",
      "country": "US",
      "line1": "27 Fredrick Ave",
      "postal_code": "97712",
      "state": "CA",
    },
    "name": "{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}",
  },
  "address": {
    "city": "Brothers",
    "country": "US",
    "line1": "27 Fredrick Ave",
    "postal_code": "97712",
    "state": "CA",
  },
})
```





```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
  email: '{{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}',
  name: '{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}',
  shipping: {
    address: {
      city: 'Brothers',
      country: 'US',
      line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',
      postal_code: '97712',
      state: 'CA',
    },
    name: '{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}',
  },
  address: {
    city: 'Brothers',
    country: 'US',
    line1: '27 Fredrick Ave',
    postal_code: '97712',
    state: 'CA',
  },
});
```





## Create the subscription [Client and Server]

> If you want to render the Payment Element without first creating a subscription, see [Collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?type=subscription).

Let your new customer choose a plan and then create the subscription – in this guide, they choose between Basic and Premium.

In your app, pass the selected price ID and the ID of the customer record to the backend.



On the back end, create the subscription with status `incomplete` using `payment_behavior=default_incomplete`. Then return the `client_secret` from the subscription’s first [payment intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents.md) to the front end to complete payment by expanding the[`confirmation_secret`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-confirmation_secret) on the latest invoice of the subscription.

To enable [improved subscription behaviour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-mode.md), set `billing_mode[type]` to `flexible`. You must use Stripe API version [2025-06-30.basil](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/basil.md#2025-06-30.basil) or later.

Set [save_default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method) to `on_subscription` to save the payment method as the default for a subscription when a payment succeeds. Saving a default payment method increases the success rate of future subscription payments.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def create_subscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    customer_id = data['customerId']
    price_id = data['priceId']

    try:
        # Create the subscription. Note we're expanding the Subscription's
        # latest invoice and that invoice's confirmation_secret
        # so we can pass it to the front end to confirm the payment
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.create(
            customer=customer_id,
            items=[{
                'price': price_id,
            }],
            payment_behavior='default_incomplete',
            payment_settings={'save_default_payment_method': 'on_subscription'},
            billing_mode={'type': 'flexible'},
            expand=['latest_invoice.confirmation_secret'],
        )
        return jsonify(subscriptionId=subscription.id, clientSecret=subscription.latest_invoice.confirmation_secret.client_secret)

    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error={'message': e.user_message}), 400
```



> If you’re using a *multi-currency Price* (A single Price object can support multiple currencies. Each purchase uses one of the supported currencies for the Price, depending on how you use the Price in your integration), use the [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create.md#create_subscription-currency) parameter to tell the Subscription which of the Price’s currencies to use. (If you omit the `currency` parameter, then the Subscription uses the Price’s default currency.)

At this point the Subscription is `inactive` and awaiting payment. Here’s an example response. The minimum fields to store are highlighted, but store whatever your application frequently accesses.

## Collect payment information [Client]

Use the [Payment Sheet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/in-app-payment-sheet.md) to collect payment details and activate the subscription. You can customise Elements to match the look and feel of your application.

The Payment Sheet securely collects all necessary payment details for a wide variety of payments methods. Learn about the [supported payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#product-support) for Payment Sheet and Subscriptions.

### Add the Payment Element to your app

> This step shows one way to get started, but you can use any [in-app payments integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/integration.md).

Initialise and present the Mobile Payment Element using the PaymentSheet class.



The Mobile Payment Element renders a sheet that allows your customer to select a payment method. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method that they select.

Setting `allowsDelayedPaymentMethods` to true allows [delayed notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) payment methods like US bank accounts. For these payment methods, the final payment status isn’t known when the `PaymentSheet` completes, and instead succeeds or fails later. If you support these types of payment methods, inform the customer their order is confirmed and only fulfil their order (for example, ship their product) when the payment is successful.

You can customise the Payment Element to match the design of your app by using the [`appearance` property](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md?platform=ios) your `PaymentSheet.Configuration` object.

### Confirm payment

The Mobile Payment Element creates a PaymentMethod and confirms the incomplete Subscription’s first PaymentIntent, causing a charge to be made. If *Strong Customer Authentication* (Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a regulatory requirement in effect as of September 14, 2019, that impacts many European online payments. It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase) (SCA) is required for the payment, the Payment Element handles the authentication process before confirming the PaymentIntent.

## Set up a return URL (iOS only) [Client-side]

When a customer exits your app (for example to authenticate in Safari or their banking app), provide a way for them to automatically return to your app. Many payment method types *require* a return URL. If you don’t provide one, we can’t present payment methods that require a return URL to your users, even if you’ve enabled them.

To provide a return URL:

1. [Register](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app#Register-your-URL-scheme) a custom URL. Universal links aren’t supported.
1. [Configure](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking) your custom URL.
1. Set up your root component to forward the URL to the Stripe SDK as shown below.

> If you’re using Expo, [set your scheme](https://docs.expo.io/guides/linking/#in-a-standalone-app) in the `app.json` file.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import { Linking } from 'react-native';
import { useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

export default function MyApp() {
  const { handleURLCallback } = useStripe();

  const handleDeepLink = useCallback(
    async (url: string | null) => {
      if (url) {
        const stripeHandled = await handleURLCallback(url);
        if (stripeHandled) {
          // This was a Stripe URL - you can return or add extra handling here as you see fit
        } else {
          // This was NOT a Stripe URL – handle as you normally would
        }
      }
    },
    [handleURLCallback]
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    const getUrlAsync = async () => {
      const initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURL();
      handleDeepLink(initialUrl);
    };

    getUrlAsync();

    const deepLinkListener = Linking.addEventListener(
      'url',
      (event: { url: string }) => {
        handleDeepLink(event.url);
      }
    );

    return () => deepLinkListener.remove();
  }, [handleDeepLink]);

  return (
    <View>
      <AwesomeAppComponent />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Additionally, set the `returnURL` when you call the `initPaymentSheet` method:

```js
await initPaymentSheet({
  ...
  returnURL: 'your-app://stripe-redirect',
  ...
});
```

For more information on native URL schemes, refer to the [Android](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app) docs.

## Optional: Enable Apple Pay

### Register for an Apple Merchant ID

Obtain an Apple Merchant ID by [registering for a new identifier](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/merchant) on the Apple Developer website.

Fill out the form with a description and identifier. Your description is for your own records and you can modify it in the future. Stripe recommends using the name of your app as the identifier (for example, `merchant.com.{{YOUR_APP_NAME}}`).

### Create a new Apple Pay certificate

Create a certificate for your app to encrypt payment data.

Go to the [iOS Certificate Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/ios_certificates) in the Dashboard, click **Add new application**, and follow the guide.

Download a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file to get a secure certificate from Apple that allows you to use Apple Pay.

One CSR file must be used to issue exactly one certificate. If you switch your Apple Merchant ID, you must go to the [iOS Certificate Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/ios_certificates) in the Dashboard to obtain a new CSR and certificate.

### Integrate with Xcode

Add the Apple Pay capability to your app. In Xcode, open your project settings, click the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, and add the **Apple Pay** capability. You might be prompted to log in to your developer account at this point. Select the merchant ID you created earlier, and your app is ready to accept Apple Pay.
![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/xcode.a701d4c1922d19985e9c614a6f105bf1.png)

Enable the Apple Pay capability in Xcode

### Add Apple Pay

#### Recurring payments

When you call `initPaymentSheet`, pass in an [ApplePayParams](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/modules/PaymentSheet.html#ApplePayParams) with `merchantCountryCode` set to the country code of your business.

In accordance with [Apple’s guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pay#Supporting-subscriptions) for recurring payments, you must also set a `cardItems` that includes a [RecurringCartSummaryItem](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/modules/ApplePay.html#RecurringCartSummaryItem) with the amount you intend to charge (for example, “$59.95 a month”).

You can also adopt [merchant tokens](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens/) by setting the `request` with its `type` set to `PaymentRequestType.Recurring`

To learn more about how to use recurring payments with Apple Pay, see [Apple’s PassKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentrequest).

### Order tracking

To add [order tracking](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/technologies/wallet/designing-order-tracking) information in iOS 16 or later, configure a `setOrderTracking` callback function. Stripe calls your implementation after the payment is complete, but before iOS dismisses the Apple Pay sheet.

In your implementation of `setOrderTracking` callback function, fetch the order details from your server for the completed order, and pass the details to the provided `completion` function.

To learn more about order tracking, see [Apple’s Wallet Orders documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletorders).



## Listen for webhooks [Server]

To complete the integration, you need to process *webhooks* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) sent by Stripe. These are events triggered whenever state inside of Stripe changes, such as subscriptions creating new invoices. In your application, set up an HTTP handler to accept a POST request containing the webhook event, and verify the signature of the event:

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_received():
  # You can use webhooks to receive information about asynchronous payment events.
  # For more about our webhook events check out https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks.
  webhook_secret = os.getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
  request_data = json.loads(request.data)

  if webhook_secret:
    # Retrieve the event by verifying the signature using the raw body and secret if webhook signing is configured.
    signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')
    try:
      event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
        payload=request.data, sig_header=signature, secret=webhook_secret)
      data = event['data']
    except Exception as e:
      return e
    # Get the type of webhook event sent - used to check the status of PaymentIntents.
    event_type = event['type']
  else:
    data = request_data['data']
    event_type = request_data['type']

  data_object = data['object']

  if event_type == 'invoice.paid':
    # Used to provision services after the trial has ended.
    # The status of the invoice will show up as paid. Store the status in your
    # database to reference when a user accesses your service to avoid hitting rate
    # limits.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'invoice.payment_failed':
    # If the payment fails or the customer does not have a valid payment method,
    # an invoice.payment_failed event is sent, the subscription becomes past_due.
    # Use this webhook to notify your user that their payment has
    # failed and to retrieve new card details.
    print(data)

  if event_type == 'customer.subscription.deleted':
    # handle subscription canceled automatically based
    # upon your subscription settings. Or if the user cancels it.
    print(data)

  return jsonify({'status': 'success'})
```



During development, use the Stripe CLI to [observe webhooks and forward them to your application](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook). Run the following in a new terminal while your development app is running:

#### curl

```bash
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

For production, set up a webhook endpoint URL in the Dashboard, or use the [Webhook Endpoints API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints.md).

You need to listen to a few events to complete the remaining steps in this guide. See [Subscription events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md#events) for more details about subscription-specific webhooks.

## Provision access to your service [Client and Server]

Now that the subscription is active, give your user access to your service.  To do this, listen to the `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.  These events pass a subscription object which contains a `status` field indicating whether the subscription is active, overdue, or cancelled.  See [the subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md#subscription-lifecycle) for a complete list of statuses.

In your webhook handler:

1. Verify the subscription status.  If it’s `active` then your user has paid for your product.
1. Check the product the customer subscribed to and grant access to your service. Checking the product instead of the price gives you more flexibility if you need to change the pricing or billing interval.
1. Store the `product.id`, `subscription.id` and `subscription.status` in your database along with the `customer.id` you already saved.  Check this record when determining which features to enable for the user in your application.

The state of a subscription might change at any point during its lifetime, even if your application does not directly make any calls to Stripe.  For example, a renewal might fail due to an expired credit card, which puts the subscription into an overdue state.  Or, if you implement the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md), a user might cancel their subscription without directly visiting your application.  Implementing your handler correctly keeps your application state in sync with Stripe.

## Cancel the subscription [Client and Server]

It’s common to allow customers to cancel their subscriptions. This example adds a cancellation option to the account settings page.

The example collects the subscription ID on the front end, but your application can get this information from your database for your logged-in user.
![Sample subscription cancellation interface.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fixed-price-subscriptions-guide-account-settings.6559626ba4b434826a67abfea165e097.png)

Account settings with the ability to cancel the subscription



On the back end, define the endpoint for your app to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/cancel-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def cancelSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
         # Cancel the subscription by deleting it
        deletedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.delete(data['subscriptionId'])
        return jsonify(deletedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your back end receives a `customer.subscription.deleted` event.

After the subscription is cancelled, update your database to remove the Stripe subscription ID you previously stored, and limit access to your service.

When a subscription is cancelled, it can’t be reactivated. Instead, collect updated billing information from your customer, update their default payment method, and create a new subscription with their existing customer record.

### Monitor events

Set up webhooks to listen to subscription change events, such as upgrades and cancellations. Learn more about [subscription webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md). You can view events in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events) or with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook).

For more details, see [testing your Billing integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing.md).

## Optional: Let customers change their plans [Client and Server]

To let your customers change their subscription, collect the price ID of the option they want to change to. Then send the new price ID from the app to a back end endpoint. This example also passes the subscription ID, but you can retrieve it from your database for your logged-in user.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call, passing the subscription ID and the new price ID. The subscription is now Premium, at 15 USD per month, instead of Basic at 5 USD per month.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/update-subscription', methods=['POST'])
def updateSubscription():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        updatedSubscription = stripe.Subscription.modify(
            data['subscriptionId'],
            cancel_at_period_end=False,
            items=[{
                'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
            }]
        )
        return jsonify(updatedSubscription)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```





Your application receives a `customer.subscription.updated` event.

## Optional: Preview a price change [Client and Server]

When your customer changes their subscription, there’s often an adjustment to the amount they owe, known as a [proration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md). You can use the [create preview invoice endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview.md) to display the adjusted amount to your customers.

From the app, pass the preview invoice details to a back end endpoint.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your front end to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/create-preview-invoice', methods=['POST'])
def createPreviewInvoice():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        # Retrieve the subscription
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(data['subscriptionId'])

        # Retrieve the invoice
        invoice = stripe.Invoice.create_preview(
            customer=data['customerId'],
            subscription=data['subscriptionId'],
            subscription_details={
              "items": [
                  {
                      'id': subscription['items']['data'][0].id,
                      'deleted': True,
                  },
                  {
                      'price': 'price_H1NlVtpo6ubk0m',
                      'deleted': False,
                  }
              ]
            }
        )
        return jsonify(invoice)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```


## Optional: Display the customer payment method [Client and Server]

Displaying the brand and last four digits of your customer’s card can help them know which card is being charged, or if they need to update their payment method.

On the front end, send the payment method ID to a back-end endpoint that retrieves the payment method details.



On the back end, define the endpoint for your app to call.

#### Python

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

@app.route('/retrieve-customer-payment-method', methods=['POST'])
def retrieveCustomerPaymentMethod():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    try:
        paymentMethod = stripe.PaymentMethod.retrieve(
            data['paymentMethodId'],
        )
        return jsonify(paymentMethod)
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 403
```

> We recommend that you save the `paymentMethod.id` and `last4` in your database, for example, `paymentMethod.id` as `stripeCustomerPaymentMethodId` in your `users` collection or table. You can optionally store `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `fingerprint`, `billing_details` as needed. This is to limit the number of calls you make to Stripe – for both performance efficiency and to avoid possible rate limiting.
